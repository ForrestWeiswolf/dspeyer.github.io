<h3 id="from-the-notes-of-igneous">From the notes of Igneous</h3>
<p>For the first week of the trip, Igneous was very responsible. He made the modifications to the power armor. And while the welds were cooling, he advised his comrades on leather-working, and went down to the shooting gallery and learned to use projectile weaponry. He even figured out how to adapt Artery Cauterizing Shot to work with hydrostatic shock (you don't want to know). And this wasn't just because he was waiting for Octocat's translations.</p>
<p>But one week was enough, and he then descended upon the human genetics lab like a one man swarm of locusts.</p>
<p>The humans really had made an incredible breakthrough. The usual problem with splicing a complex phenotypes into adults is that the fetal morphogen cascade don't happen. But they do occur in potentia via teleological imperative in a transfiguration such as lycanthropy. There's no sign that Luna's design notes have been obtained (or existed in the first place) but the Humans found the first 10^11 eigenvectors...</p>
<hr />
<p>At about this point, Igneous's notes become illegible. And his cries from the lab include phrases like &quot;differentiable along any definition of life&quot; and &quot;those short sighted fools: I'll show them!&quot;. By the time the whale arrived in Sigil, only blood curdling yowls could be heard from the inside, and a sign on the door read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DO NOT ENTER FOR ANY REASON.<br />
(if we have arrived in sigil, please procure for me one (1) bat, any species, preferably alive)</p>

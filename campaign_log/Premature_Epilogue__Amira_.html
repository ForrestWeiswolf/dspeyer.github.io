<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve hurt people, not because enemies stood between me and what I want, but because mercy stood between me and what I want.</p>
<p>I’ve forsaken Sigmar’s blessings, not because they are from Sigmar, but because they are blessings.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amira’s conversion is not that she doesn’t believe in Sigmar’s ideals anymore - order and civilization - it’s that she still values those things, but has come to believe that betraying her values will get her closer to understanding what she wants to understand, and is sufficiently crazy at this point to go ahead with that.</p>
<p>(A true Malalite would convert, thereby betraying him, and become Unaligned, thereby self-destructively making themself an enemy of the powers that be and the world in general. But Amira doesn't quite have the right frame of mind to think of that.)</p>
<h2 id="goals-plans">Goals, plans</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Any door might have a secret behind it, a fragment or a hint at the meaning of the greater Secret. And every person has secrets inside, that no one else knows. That’s why I carry a sword.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing we must imagine her doing is summoning the motorcycle again and disassembling it. Not because it’s a blessing from Sigmar, but because it’s a blessing, and that’s reason enough to destroy it.</p>
<p>(There could be a Cavalier / Blackguard progression... with her stealing a normal vehicle, and refusing to use divine bond out of spite.)</p>
<p>From there.. well, her goal is to understand the secret she learned.</p>
<p>Part of that is seeking forbidden knowledge. The kind of things justiciars are supposed to prevent people from finding out... which just means she knows where to look. Maybe tracking down associates of the person it was she learned the secret from.</p>
<p>The other part is destroying or abandoning anything that stops her from understanding it. At this point, she may see sanity as such an obstacle. She might go out of her way to burn bridges with her old life, or work against things she used to care about, believing that will get her closer to the truth.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, it’s almost reasonable that she might commandeer a ship and go back to Yehket - before she fell, she tried pretty hard to stop the necromancer from getting out to the rest of the wheel, and on top of that, it <em>might</em> know something about what she’s seeking.</p>
<p>Malal’s third commandment prohibits aiding others, but if you’re aiding a murderous undead sorcerer by helping them get at more potential victims, maybe that’s sufficiently screwing over everyone else for him to let it slide.</p>
<p>Another possible scheme would be if she hears about some specific gate or door that should not be opened, and latches on to the idea of seeing what’s through it. Previously, the compulsion to open things only came up when she was physically near them, and she had some restraint about it, but this is the villainous version of Amira, so...</p>

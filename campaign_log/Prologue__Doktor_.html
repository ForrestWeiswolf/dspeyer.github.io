    <h1 id="prologue-doktor">Prologue: Doktor</h1>
<p>Doktor Meetslab found himself working in one of the most notoriously dangerous fast food joints in the Astral Sea: Sleepy Pete's BBQ Pork, Ribs &amp; Open Heart Surgery. Quoted by the Council as the best BBQ in the Wheel and the most dangerous crisis zone on western Sigil, Sleepy Pete's Rinds and Rest can be found deep within an abandoned junkyard. The crime there is so bad, barbed wire is frequently stolen from the fences. Live land mines were placed, but they disappeared. There was a termite infestation, but somebody stole the termites. The guard dogs were stolen, and replaced with mutated, fire-breathing pigs; so large that a pack of them took out a group of mercenaries in power armor. That's probably how the authorities learned not to go there. Yet the line to Sleepy Pete's would stretch onto the street. One customer had lost a leg, and as he sat and ate his sandwich as vital fluids fled from his body, a smile crossed his pale lips and he whispered: &quot;I'd eat here again.&quot;</p>
<p>Such was the power of Sleepy Pete's, that Pete lived to tell the tale after claiming that the Lady of Pain herself had enjoyed one of his sandwiches.</p>
<p>It is dangerous work, only suitable for the most durable, both physically and mentally. Doktor Meetslab learned of the many flavors of heart failure one could experience eating at Sleepy Pete's and apprenticed as a medical officer himself, even if he was no good at it.</p>
<p>While Meetslab was clumsy, awkward, terrible with words, soft in the head and bad at remembering orders, he was durable. And Sleepy Pete's Bacon &amp; Medical Travesties had never had an employee that bad last that long. Doktor was fitted in one of the restaurant's standard power armor uniforms and drilled in the proper serving procedures. Learning valuable lessons in combat, medicine and toilet cleaning, Meetslab survived working at Sleepy Pete's Intestinal cancer and Pulled Pork long enough to glance into the secret forbidden sandwich lore and lose several limbs in a tragic fried rocket-weasel incident. Meetslab was fitted with Darksteel limbs Pete had lying in the stash because he didn't want to fix him again.</p>
<p>Sometime later Doktor went for a bathroom break and the rest is history.</p>

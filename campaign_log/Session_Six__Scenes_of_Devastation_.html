<h3 id="from-the-logs-of-doktor">From the logs of Doktor</h3>
<p>Inside we found a somewhat chaotic scene.</p>
<p>Our target, Lexical Scribs was there, along with several dead soldiers, killed by a Capuchin Buccaneer Monkey. As we were subduing the Simian, our target, Lexical Scribs, panicked about something horrible being released. A tank emerged, inside it was the adorable Octocat, who Charmed Doktor Meetslab with her mind magic. Doktor Meetslab, having decided that she was the cutest thing he had ever seen, made her part of the crew, and allowed her to ride on his shoulder.</p>
<p>The monkey was easily dispatched, and Scribs was captured. Morty interrgated Skribs, and intimidated him so well that Scribs was driven insane and knocked unconscious from the shock. So he was hauled back to the ship to be dealt with later.</p>
<p>The crew delved ever deeper in search for loot. And they found a stupid, horrible, ugly, disgusting, THIEVING FUCKING HAFLING. Who stole MY AMULET. WAAAAAAAAGH!</p>
<p>Ahem. I meant to say that we had an encounter with the famed &quot;Thief of the Stars.&quot; The perceptive Octocat spotted this Hafling as he was rifling through our stuff. We immediately attacked him. Morty and Meetslab both got the drop on him, Meetslab throwing a knife at him and Morty tackling him to the ground. But it was for nought, he was too fast. Before Octocat could... befriend him, he escaped by jumping into a screen.</p>
<p>He seemed to posses the peculiar ability to traverse the umbra, exiting and entering through shiny, reflective surfaces.</p>
<p>There was some panic, after which the crew contacted their ship to make sure everything was ok. Turned out the thief had been seen on the ship and jumped into a mirror. There was some panic as we ran back to the ship, but it amounted to nothing. The thief had vanished. We keep looting, Octocat found a belt for herself along with three feather tokens: Boat, Anchor and Tree.</p>
<p>Morty found an odd box. He picked it up and upon touching it he felt his blood attempting to leave his body. Thinking quickly, he chopped off the hand that had touched the box before the effect had spread to the rest of his body. The chopped off hand shriveled up and became a lizard hand, for Morty was in truth a lizardman disguising himself as human leaders.</p>
<p>Deciding that the worst had past, Morty then opened the box, activating a magical trap that he failed to resist. Morty was paralyzed and his sight and hearing was replaced by some sort of human music video on repeat.</p>
<p>Not that the crew could tell, as far as they knew, Morty had simply been incapacitated, so he was hauled back to the ship to be deal with later. Inside the box he opened we found Helvetica's Irrevocably Advancing Marble. A marble that once activated was supposedly unstoppable.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Lexical Scribs came to, and was interrogated by Tau Bond. Lexical had gone quite mad, raving of conspiracies and whatnot, and was quite uncooperative. However Octocat was able to assist by... befriending Scribs, who at the command to 'reveal' revealed everything. The key we were looking for was a priestess Tarot card covered in blood.</p>
<p>The card somehow functions as a portable portal. When the card is damaged, any who have spilled their blood upon it within a small radius around it are immediately teleported to the lost human outpost.</p>
<p>Meanwhile meanwhile, Meetslab had an encounter with the Keyhoarder himself, a humanoid of indeterminate race that had accumulated many keys to Sigil doors. He asked for Lexical Scribs and the card, but Meetslab didn't know about any of this yet. The Keyhoarder left back to Sigil through a door by reciting &quot;open sesame&quot;</p>
<p>Doktor Meetslab was presented with a choice to attempt to follow him, returning to Sigil, and potentially, to his old life. He eventually decided against it, as leaving his crew would be irresponsible of him.</p>
<p>As they left they took the opportunity to test the marble, finding out that it was, indeed, impossible to stop once it started moving. Walls posed no obstacle whatsoever, as it merely bored through them without slowing. It's irrevocable advancability was put to the ultimate test when it was launched towards the crystal sphere they had just left. It didn't slow. The crystal sphere moved with the marble, meaning the crew now had access to a truly world altering power.</p>
<p>The crew left in both ships. Awkwardly, they only had one navigator between them, so they had to connect the ships via tow cables. They traveled to Centuria to collect their reward, however, something terrible had happened. The Necromancer Orobas had found his way to Centuria, and had caused there to be an apocalyptic amount of zombies everywhere. Seeing Centuria as a lost cause, the crew quickly scooped up as many civilian crew as they could carry and made way to Sparrow's Peak...</p>

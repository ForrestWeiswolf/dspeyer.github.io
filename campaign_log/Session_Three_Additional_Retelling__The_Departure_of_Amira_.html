<p>When we ran afoul of Centuria's police, Doktor Meatslab attempted diplomacy. This was probably where things started to go wrong.</p>
<p>When they freaked out so deeply about the amulet, he radioed me for advice. But I hadn't had a chance to study the amulet, so I told him to try to be nice, and that they might well know something. When they asked him to put on handcuffs, he agreed, confident that he could snap the chain if necessary.</p>
<p>Which was why M'k saw his comrade in handcuffs and attacked.</p>
<p>While this was happening, I was trying to negotiate with Amira. She acknowledged that we were the lesser evil she'd recently met, and that we had saved her life. But she still refused to agree to any terms we could live with.</p>
<p>As negotiations turned dark, she uttered a terrifying phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my hour of need, Sigmar has blessed me with a motorcycle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She ran me over. I wasn't badly hurt, but by the time I got up she was gone.</p>
<p>She rode her motorcycle right into the midst of the confusing fight between Doktor, M'k and the local police, who had by now summoned a helicopter for backup. A powerful evocation flashed down from the helicopter at Amira, who caught and returned it. And <em>then</em> realized she'd killed several police officers.</p>
<p>In that confusion, our remaining crew made it onboard, grabbing the surviving cops as hostages. We took off, leaving Amira behind.</p>
<p>I won't tell you how I know what happened to her after that, but it went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Psst, buddy, I love the way you murdered those cops</strong></p>
<p>What? Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>I'm Malal. You know, Sigmar is <em>not</em> going to be happy with you over this. You should work for me instead.</strong></p>
<p>I'd been feeling like I'd need to leave Sigmar's service soon anyway. But I'd been thinking maybe Acerak --</p>
<p><strong>You don't want Acerak. You want me. I'm the real deal.</strong></p>
<p>I suppose you are. All right. I accept.</p>
<p><strong>Groovy. First order of business: this neighborhoor's about to blow up. Abandon them to their fate and skedaddle.</strong></p>
<p>That sounds wise.</p>

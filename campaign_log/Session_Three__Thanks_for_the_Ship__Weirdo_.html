<h3 id="from-the-logs-of-mksplswap">From the logs of M'K'Splswap</h3>
<h2 id="scene-1-escape-from-yehket">Scene 1: Escape from Yehket</h2>
<p>The party, missing only Morty with M'k again ambulatory, scoped out the Skylords' base, where the spelljammer Bumbling Mark was currently docked. The presumed vampire from the golden box had commandeered the ship and presumably staffed it with zombies (of unknown capability to infect others). Vampire weirdo, who seemed to possess powerful Necromancy and Conjuration at the very least and with whom we didn't particularly want to fuck, was seen teleporting away, perhaps looking for victims.</p>
<p>Frederick Jefferson, himself approaching the base, perhaps to investigate, was found and kindly encouraged to aid the party in crewing the Bumbling Mark and escaping the Weirdo.</p>
<p>Igneous bravely snuck in, neutralizing several zombies before calling in the others to help loot. During the looting, we found an improvised brig containing former Skylord Dewey Scrub, whom we pressed into service, and our erstwhile captain Nok Takinstuf, whom we allowed back only with a demotion to First Officer. The good Doktor was needed to convince Nok of the wisdom of this decision.</p>
<p>Scarlett got a hell of a shot. By Vectron, you should have seen it.</p>
<p>We were able to retrieve a good amount of loot before hightailing it out of the sphere (hoping to avoid conflict with the Weirdo, whose name was apparently Orobas and who demanded obeisance to himself above Vectron and thus with whom there could be no parley), including a necklace, at which M'k did not then get a look -- regrettably, as it turned out.</p>
<p>Out in the Astral Sea, we check the ship more thoroughly, finding zombies but, to our relief, no Weirdos. We made our way to a quiet backwater of the Wheel, lied low, and convalesced.</p>
<h2 id="scene-2-hello-centuria">Scene 2: Hello, Centuria</h2>
<p>A good few weeks of bed rest having healed us from our near-death wounds, we were ready to set out to sell loot, buy Doktor some gloves and a sweet greathammer, and hire more crew, when we realized that Amira was probably going to turn us in to the Popo Empire's security forces, that being her, you know, job. We decided that Amira, who, yes, boarded and ruined the LLST (RIP) that one time, but who did also fight on our side for a while, would be watched until we were ready to leave, and quarantined from communications, but then released unharmed right before we again made ourselves scarce.</p>
<p>The loot was sold and the hammer successfully purchased, at the cost of meeting a very annoying fairy who wanted us to kill a religion by killing a god-whale (thus ending its eternal god-whale war, natch). This seemed worthwhile, in the name of Vectron's unchallenged hegemony, but, man, that fairy. M'k told it not to call us -- we'd call it.</p>
<p>Only one new redshirt, Alta, was hired before Nok fell under suspicion for attempting to hire several members of the Popo po-po, at which point things became less than utterly chill. Nok was intimidated to the point that he broke alignment, praising Vectron (praise Vectron!), his strength utterly leaving him. We learned that Nok was working with Amira to betray us.</p>
<h2 id="interlude-igneous-gets-a-lab-and-another-lab-and...">Interlude: Igneous Gets a Lab, and Another Lab, and...</h2>
<h3 id="from-the-logs-of-igneous">From the logs of Igneous</h3>
<p>While his injured comrades were convalescing, Igneous bought basic supplies for labs. Enough to do standard stuff in biology, neurology, genetics, electronics, robotics, gunsmithing, chemistry and magic.</p>
<p>The ship doesn't have room for separate labs per subject, or even really one lab, but the purchases included some folding tables, none of the supplies are really bulky (except maybe the 3d printer / laser carver, but even that's less than a cubic meter), and Igneous is willing to turn half his bed into supply storage.</p>
<h2 id="scene-3-goodbye-centuria">Scene 3: Goodbye, Centuria</h2>
<p>Our ship had been recognized as a stolen vehicle, and the local gendarmerie arrived to investigate; talking to them, Doktor learned they were looking for Nok and the necklace, both of which Doktor happily proffered.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the necklace, the cop seemed to panic, bagging the thing, handcuffing Doktor, and calling for backup.</p>
<p>M'k, who had been unsuccessfully looking for more crew, just then returned to the ship, saw Meetslab in cuffs, and attacked, killing an officer and wounding another. Doktor broke his bonds, and the battle was won in short order (and the necklace retrieved). Doktor carried two Popo officers onto the ship as hostages.</p>
<p>Amira cast Divine Bond and escaped, accidentally running over the wounded officer and drawing friendly fire. She defended herself, defeating the glorified mall cops who were ostensibly on her side, and as she did, a darkly portentous look of satisfaction could briefly be seen to pass over her face.</p>
<p>With the party reunited and the Bumbling Mark barely functional on a skeleton crew, we hastily appointed Doktor Meetslab as captain and made a beeline for the crystal sphere. Somehow, that damned fairy had caught up, and, again somehow, had managed to join the crew. A pursuing police vehicle dodged the first mine we dropped in their path, prompting a crisis of faith for Meetslab as he blew up the entire town full of people below; we only prevailed by laying another mine just outside the sphere, which they could not dodge in time.</p>
<p>We escaped by the skin of Vectron's pearly-white teeth.</p>

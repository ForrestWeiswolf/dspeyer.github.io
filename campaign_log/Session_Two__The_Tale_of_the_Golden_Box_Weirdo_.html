<p>Meanwhile in Sigil, an atheist ork named Doktor Meetslab (&quot;Doktor&quot; is given name, not title) tried to go to the bathroom. Because bad things happen to atheists, even in Sigil, the bathroom door turned into a one-time portal.</p>
<p>We arrived in Village #2 and knocked on the healer's door. Out stepped Doktor Meetslab, confused, with his fly down. After a bit of confusion and panic, we found the actual healer and gave our wounded into his care.</p>
<p>Minus two wounded comrades but plus one ork (who liked the idea of stealing a spelljammer and getting off this planet), we set out to ambush an isolated and vulnerable party of Skylords. We had vague thoughts that after a handful of such ambushes, we might get their numbers down enough for a frontal assault on their base.</p>
<p>The ambush went well. The party had been gathering valuable wreckage from our ship, so we got a bunch of treasure too. Amidst the treasure was a strange golden box emitting incomprehensible radio signals. We opened the box to reveal an undead creature, which presumably had been locked there since the civilization we'd grave-robbed fell. The creature attacked us, but when it saw how dangerous we were it fled.</p>
<p>Doktor Meetslab chased it all the way to the Skylords' lair. The rest of us had transportation issues, but followed when we could. There was a long and complicated three-way fight.</p>
<p>At present, the Skylords are all dead, except for the one we took hostage, who took back the van and fled in an unknown direction. The crew of the spelljammer (between 6 and 12) are probably zombies, but the rest are all-the-way dead. The creature is in possession of the spelljammer. It has learned our language, and demanded our loyalty (over a radio communication). We are badly wounded and traveling to Village #2 in hopes of healing. On route, we hope to pick up a zipcar and a trailer full of loot.</p>

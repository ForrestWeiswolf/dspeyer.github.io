# Prologue: Igneous

Most crystal spheres contain planets.  Darkforge contained a black hole and five large space stations in the same circular orbit exactly 72 degrees apart.  The space stations were far closer to the event horizon than is remotely safe, but were protected by Spaghettification Compensators.

How do those work, you may ask?  Extremely well.

Who built the stations is unknown.  By the time I was born there, the place was run by an Omnisian order.  They kept the stations maintained (despite not knowing how they worked) and used probability manipulation magic to influence the Hawking radiation.  What cannot be manufactured can still emerge from the quantum vacuum, so we were the only known source of new darksteel. Each item was less than a micrometer in diameter and the shapes were random, but it was more than anyone else had.  This had military applications, so there were constant goodwill tours given to visiting high-officials-turned-diplomats.  But I digress...

I was the delight of my early teachers, especially in technology, and was allowed to enter the priesthood at age 14.  In hindsight, this was a mistake.  Sure, I was "devoted" to the Omnissiah, my devotion had faced no substantive tests, and my overall level of responsibility just wasn't.

It wasn't long before my disrespectful and emotional (that is, teenage) ways dropped me to devotion=3.  I'm fortunate I have so few lingering curses from that time.  Just my hideous visage. The Omnissiah had mercy on me for my youth.

But shortly after my 18th birthday, I'd had enough of depending on technology I didn't understand. I wanted to know how the Spaghetification Compensators worked.  At the time, one of the five stations was abandoned due to atmosphere issues.  I got a short-range SC and EVAd to the abandoned station.  I found the station's SC and slowly began disassembling it.  My intent was to understand its makeup, then reassemble it when I was done.

There were two major mistakes in this plan.

First, an intent to reassemble isn't enough for the Omnissiah.  So far as He was concerned, this was a deliberate destruction of an ancient technology.  The highest form of blasphemy.

Worse, I had assumed the five station SCs were independent.  In fact, they formed a pentagram of abjuration.  As soon as I broke this one, all five stations Spaghettiafied outside of core areas with redundant protections.

Over twenty thousand people died that day.  Including fifty-some-odd dignitaries from twelve foreign governments.  (Not including my parents, who were away on a purchasing mission -- which is why I was unsupervised enough to attempt this.  They disowned me when they learned what I'd done.)

I probably would have died if Catastrophrei hadn't saved me.  He was so impressed by my determination to know at all costs that he protected me from the Omnissiah's wrath and the usual dangers of changing religions.

There were a few spelljammers in system which came to pick up survivors.  I got aboard one and taken to a nearby sphere, then got off *that* sphere aboard a smuggler all before anyone worked out what I'd done.

I do regret killing all those people, and I would employ better safety precautions if I did it today.  But I stand by the core principle that led me to do it: we must *understand*.

# Prologue: M'K'Splswap

M'K'Splswap, known as M'k to family and as "Mick" to those bad at pronouncing Eldarin names:

Learned spear telestabbing from his eccentric father, while studying abjuration and conjuration. Grew up distrusting technology, in no small part due to his father's weird neo-Elfin worldview.

In a magical research experiment gone awry, lost his ability to teleport while wearing clothing. Relationship with his father strained when M'k misplaced family heirloom Ropey the spear-snake. (The groggy morning after a post-accident consolatory bender, Call Item summoned only a bottle).

Left school, but Prof. V felt bad regarding the experiment and provided some continued support. Left his home worldship Zeneodil to find balance and restoration. Exposed to the janitor's way.

Got WAY into Vectron. Euphorically devoted himself to fanatical personal janitorial ablutions. (Vectron doesn't mind M'k losing his clothes, given the Vectron tats beneath. Vectron's chill.) Grew old over many uneventful years of keeping various ships pristine, plus weekly UVC meetings.

# Prologue: Amira

**Obsession**

>“I sat down across the table from him, and I asked - ‘How did you do it?’. And now I *know*.”

She’d been interrogating someone, some criminal who’d done some seemingly impossible feats, and asked “How did you do it?” She was a good enough interrogator to make them talk... so know she *knows*, and it turns out there are some things you’re better off not knowing.

Knowing a secret like that can be damaging to your sanity (hence her two hinderances), which contributed to her fall. But on top of that, she’s knows, but she doesn’t understand. She was dangerously curious even before touching forbidden knowledge, so now she can’t let go of the idea, can’t resist trying to understand it.

The skills to pay most attention to are forbidden knowledge, and *intimidation*. Amira likes making people afraid of her — possibly too much. Having gone to the dark side, it might be in-character for her to demand secrets that are completely irrelevant to her, just for the sake of making someone reveal things they don’t want to.

# Prologue: Doktor Meetslab

Doktor Meetslab found himself working in one of the most notoriously dangerous fast food joints in the Astral Sea: Sleepy Pete's BBQ Pork, Ribs & Open Heart Surgery. Quoted by the Council as the best BBQ in the Wheel and the most dangerous crisis zone on western Sigil, Sleepy Pete's Rinds and Rest can be found deep within an abandoned junkyard. The crime there is so bad, barbed wire is frequently stolen from the fences. Live land mines were placed, but they disappeared. There was a termite infestation, but somebody stole the termites. The guard dogs were stolen, and replaced with mutated, fire-breathing pigs; so large that a pack of them took out a group of mercenaries in power armor.  That's probably how the authorities learned not to go there. Yet the line to Sleepy Pete's would stretch onto the street. One customer had lost a leg, and as he sat and ate his sandwich as vital fluids fled from his body, a smile crossed his pale lips and he whispered: "I'd eat here again." 

Such was the power of Sleepy Pete's, that Pete lived to tell the tale after claiming that the Lady of Pain herself had enjoyed one of his sandwiches.

It is dangerous work, only suitable for the most durable, both physically and mentally. Doktor Meetslab learned of the many flavors of heart failure one could experience eating at Sleepy Pete's and apprenticed as a medical officer himself, even if he was no good at it.

While Meetslab was clumsy, awkward, terrible with words, soft in the head and bad at remembering orders, he was durable. And Sleepy Pete's Bacon & Medical Travesties had never had an employee that bad last that long. Doktor was fitted in one of the restaurant's standard power armor uniforms and drilled in the proper serving procedures. Learning valuable lessons in combat, medicine and toilet cleaning, Meetslab survived working at Sleepy Pete's Intestinal cancer and Pulled Pork long enough to glance into the secret forbidden sandwich lore and lose several limbs in a tragic fried rocket-weasel incident. Meetslab was fitted with Darksteel limbs Pete had lying in the stash because he didn't want to fix him again. 

Sometime later Doktor went for a bathroom break and the rest is history.


# Session One: Crash!
### From the logs of M'K'Splswap

A commission on the pirate spelljammer Lip-Lip-Smakntime, now a wreck, proved less uneventful. Distrust of technology turned into a vehicle phobia when boarders and mines destroyed the LLST. (Managed to loo- recover a really sweet stilling-cloak-spear-rod, though. By Vectron's Glory!)

Crashlanded on some backwater planet with two officers, two enlisted, and an erstwhile boarder. First tasted combat when attacked by local warlards. Rather enjoyed spearing a leg straight off. Wounded while capturing hostages to learn more about said warlords. Did not enjoy being shot. (Vectron opposes shooting supporters of Vectron, the wisdom of which never seemed more clear.)

# Session One, Alternate Retelling: Insufficient Research Opportunities
### As recounted long after the fact by Igneous

## Winning a Space Battle Is Like Winning an Earthquake

Our ship, the Lip-Lip-Smakentime, had been conducting some amateur archeology when we somehow offended the Popo empire.  Why was unclear.  It wasn't their graves we were robbing.  Perhaps they bore a grudge from some previous event.

We jumped into the warp and made for an obscure world our pursuers likely didn't have a map to.  If they fell behind us by more than two geller-radii, they'd be stranded in the Warp.

They did not fall behind us.  Instead they were right on our tail when we re-entered the Astral in an unfamiliar region.

An unfamiliar region filled with mines.

Did I mention that the warp-to-astral transition requires dropping shields?

Since we were in front, we got hit hardest.  But they were bigger, so they got hit too.  We attempted an all-stop, which only made them hit us.  Which wasn't good for either ship.

So instead of studying a hold full of *fascinating* artifacts, I was at the side of the ship, jerry-rigging a rail-gun to provide just enough lateral thrust to get off the enemy's prow.

“Intruders on deck three,” the alarm warned us.  Not my problem.  Our crew is full of people who can kill boarders.  Our crew is not full of people who can jerry-rig rail guns.

We got out from in front and the enemy ship went past us at high velocity, shields still down, plowing into the minefield.  One problem down.

I stayed at the rail gun, trying to use it as a point-defense system to protect us from remaining mines.  This was moderately effective, and our ship was nearly dead when it closed with the nearby crystal sphere.  Just barely, I activated the hull and allowed us to pass through the sphere and into the atmosphere, which promptly ripped us apart.

## A New World

There were supposed to be two emergency evacuation shuttles.  Our captain had already used one (leaving him in the astral with a minefield, a crystal sphere he couldn't cross, a warp relay he couldn't use, and a severe lack of food and air – a poorly thought out act of cowardice).  On the other hand, there was the boarding shuttle the Popo had arrived in, which I stole.  

One good landing (they could walk away from it) and one great landing (I could use the shuttle again) later and we few survivors were on the ground.  One bit of delayed falling wreckage later and I could no longer use the shuttle again.

I did have enough surviving comm gear to pick up an order for someone to locate and kill us.  Friendly place.

More disturbingly, that comm net was the only signal of any sort.  We'd landed on a low-tech world.  No electronics.  No scientific instruments.  No way home.

At least the one Popo survivor, an inquisitor named Amira, decided to work with us for the time being.

## Meet the Skylords

Given a few hours I probably could have gotten one of the shuttles working, but we didn't have that.  Opting not to get caught in the open by people who wanted to kill us, we raced for the cover of a nearby forest.

The cover helped.  Instead of a fair fight, we fought a series of ambushes.  Two of our comrades were injured, but we prevailed.

The final step of the fight was eliminating their backup vehicle – a large van with a gunner seat on the roof.  M'k teleported in and killed the driver, but panicked and teleported out rather than control the vehicle.  The driver slumped on the steering wheel, and the van drove in ever accelerating circles.

I caught the van with a magnetic harpoon, a length of stretchy cable, and an improvised skateboard.  Eventually I made it inside the van and pushed the break peddle.  We had transport.

Transport that freaked M'k out.  I offered to cauterize the brain tissue responsible for the phobia, an offer which helpfully distracted M'k.  Fortunately I didn't have to go through with it.  I knew a lot of biology, but I had no experience getting my hands dirty in actual bodies at the time.

We made it to a primitive village, where the locals told us about the “Skylords” whose van we'd stolen.  They had the ability to fly and to drop bombs, which was enough to keep these locals entirely cowed.  Still, they seemed to regard us as Skylords ourselves (we did, after all, come from the sky), so they were in a somewhat confused state.  They offered us food, shelter, and a map to a village with a healer.


Finally having some downtime, I studied the captured Skylord commbeads.  Standard unencrypted voice streaming over a generic network stack implementation that was ten years old, running a general purpose operating system that couldn't receive security updates.  I pwned the entire system in minutes.  The Skylords might have the peasants cowed, but I wasn't impressed.

# Session Two: The Tale of the Golden Box Weirdo
### From the logs of Igneous

Meanwhile in Sigil, an atheist ork named Doktor Meetslab ("Doktor" is given name, not title) tried to go to the bathroom. Because bad things happen to atheists, even in Sigil, the bathroom door turned into a one-time portal.

We arrived in Village #2 and knocked on the healer's door. Out stepped Doktor Meetslab, confused, with his fly down. After a bit of confusion and panic, we found the actual healer and gave our wounded into his care.

Minus two wounded comrades but plus one ork (who liked the idea of stealing a spelljammer and getting off this planet), we set out to ambush an isolated and vulnerable party of Skylords. We had vague thoughts that after a handful of such ambushes, we might get their numbers down enough for a frontal assault on their base.

The ambush went well. The party had been gathering valuable wreckage from our ship, so we got a bunch of treasure too. Amidst the treasure was a strange golden box emitting incomprehensible radio signals. We opened the box to reveal an undead creature, which presumably had been locked there since the civilization we'd grave-robbed fell. The creature attacked us, but when it saw how dangerous we were it fled.

Doktor Meetslab chased it all the way to the Skylords' lair. The rest of us had transportation issues, but followed when we could. There was a long and complicated three-way fight.

At present, the Skylords are all dead, except for the one we took hostage, who took back the van and fled in an unknown direction. The crew of the spelljammer (between 6 and 12) are probably zombies, but the rest are all-the-way dead. The creature is in possession of the spelljammer. It has learned our language, and demanded our loyalty (over a radio communication). We are badly wounded and traveling to Village #2 in hopes of healing. On route, we hope to pick up a zipcar and a trailer full of loot.

# Session Three: Thanks for the Ship, Weirdo
### From the logs of M'K'Splswap

## Scene 1: Escape from Yehket

The party, missing only Morty with M'k again ambulatory, scoped out the Skylords' base, where the spelljammer Bumbling Mark was currently docked. The presumed vampire from the golden box had commandeered the ship and presumably staffed it with zombies (of unknown capability to infect others). Vampire weirdo, who seemed to possess powerful Necromancy and Conjuration at the very least and with whom we didn't particularly want to fuck, was seen teleporting away, perhaps looking for victims.

Frederick Jefferson, himself approaching the base, perhaps to investigate, was found and kindly encouraged to aid the party in crewing the Bumbling Mark and escaping the Weirdo.

Igneous bravely snuck in, neutralizing several zombies before calling in the others to help loot. During the looting, we found an improvised brig containing former Skylord Dewey Scrub, whom we pressed into service, and our erstwhile captain Nok Takinstuf, whom we allowed back only with a demotion to First Officer. The good Doktor was needed to convince Nok of the wisdom of this decision.

Scarlett got a hell of a shot. By Vectron, you should have seen it.

We were able to retrieve a good amount of loot before hightailing it out of the sphere (hoping to avoid conflict with the Weirdo, whose name was apparently Orobas and who demanded obeisance to himself above Vectron and thus with whom there could be no parley), including a necklace, at which M'k did not then get a look -- regrettably, as it turned out.

Out in the Astral Sea, we check the ship more thoroughly, finding zombies but, to our relief, no Weirdos. We made our way to a quiet backwater of the Wheel, lied low, and convalesced.

## Scene 2: Hello, Centuria

A good few weeks of bed rest having healed us from our near-death wounds, we were ready to set out to sell loot, buy Doktor some gloves and a sweet greathammer, and hire more crew, when we realized that Amira was probably going to turn us in to the Popo Empire's security forces, that being her, you know, job. We decided that Amira, who, yes, boarded and ruined the LLST (RIP) that one time, but who did also fight on our side for a while, would be watched until we were ready to leave, and quarantined from communications, but then released unharmed right before we again made ourselves scarce.

The loot was sold and the hammer successfully purchased, at the cost of meeting a very annoying fairy who wanted us to kill a religion by killing a god-whale (thus ending its eternal god-whale war, natch). This seemed worthwhile, in the name of Vectron's unchallenged hegemony, but, man, that fairy. M'k told it not to call us -- we'd call it.

Only one new redshirt, Alta, was hired before Nok fell under suspicion for attempting to hire several members of the Popo po-po, at which point things became less than utterly chill. Nok was intimidated to the point that he broke alignment, praising Vectron (praise Vectron!), his strength utterly leaving him. We learned that Nok was working with Amira to betray us.

## Interlude: Igneous Gets a Lab, and Another Lab, and...
### From the logs of Igneous

While his injured comrades were convalescing, Igneous bought basic supplies for labs.  Enough to do standard stuff in biology, neurology, genetics, electronics, robotics, gunsmithing, chemistry and magic.  

The ship doesn't have room for separate labs per subject, or even really one lab, but the purchases included some folding tables, none of the supplies are really bulky (except maybe the 3d printer / laser carver, but even that's less than a cubic meter), and Igneous is willing to turn half his bed into supply storage.

## Scene 3: Goodbye, Centuria

Our ship had been recognized as a stolen vehicle, and the local gendarmerie arrived to investigate; talking to them, Doktor learned they were looking for Nok and the necklace, both of which Doktor happily proffered.

Upon seeing the necklace, the cop seemed to panic, bagging the thing, handcuffing Doktor, and calling for backup.

M'k, who had been unsuccessfully looking for more crew, just then returned to the ship, saw Meetslab in cuffs, and attacked, killing an officer and wounding another. Doktor broke his bonds, and the battle was won in short order (and the necklace retrieved). Doktor carried two Popo officers onto the ship as hostages.

Amira cast Divine Bond and escaped, accidentally running over the wounded officer and drawing friendly fire. She defended herself, defeating the glorified mall cops who were ostensibly on her side, and as she did, a darkly portentous look of satisfaction could briefly be seen to pass over her face.

With the party reunited and the Bumbling Mark barely functional on a skeleton crew, we hastily appointed Doktor Meetslab as captain and made a beeline for the crystal sphere. Somehow, that damned fairy had caught up, and, again somehow, had managed to join the crew. A pursuing police vehicle dodged the first mine we dropped in their path, prompting a crisis of faith for Meetslab as he blew up the entire town full of people below; we only prevailed by laying another mine just outside the sphere, which they could not dodge in time.

We escaped by the skin of Vectron's pearly-white teeth.

# Session Three Additional Retelling: The Departure of Amira
### As recounted long after the fact by Igneous

When we ran afoul of Centuria's police, Doktor Meatslab attempted diplomacy.  This was probably where things started to go wrong.

When they freaked out so deeply about the amulet, he radioed me for advice.  But I hadn't had a chance to study the amulet, so I told him to try to be nice, and that they might well know something.  When they asked him to put on handcuffs, he agreed, confident that he could snap the chain if necessary.

Which was why M'k saw his comrade in handcuffs and attacked.

While this was happening, I was trying to negotiate with Amira.  She acknowledged that we were the lesser evil she'd recently met, and that we had saved her life.  But she still refused to agree to any terms we could live with.

As negotiations turned dark, she uttered a terrifying phrase:

> In my hour of need, Sigmar has blessed me with a motorcycle.

She ran me over.  I wasn't badly hurt, but by the time I got up she was gone.

She rode her motorcycle right into the midst of the confusing fight between Doktor, M'k and the local police, who had by now summoned a helicopter for backup.  A powerful evocation flashed down from the helicopter at Amira, who caught and returned it.  And *then* realized she'd killed several police officers.

In that confusion, our remaining crew made it onboard, grabbing the surviving cops as hostages.  We took off, leaving Amira behind.

I won't tell you how I know what happened to her after that, but it went something like this:

> **Psst, buddy, I love the way you murdered those cops**
>
> What?  Who are you?
>
> **I'm Malal.  You know, Sigmar is *not* going to be happy with you over this.  You should work for me instead.**
>
> I'd been feeling like I'd need to leave Sigmar's service soon anyway.  But I'd been thinking maybe Acerak --
>
> **You don't want Acerak.  You want me.  I'm the real deal.**
>
> I suppose you are.  All right.  I accept.
>
> **Groovy.  First order of business: this neighborhoor's about to blow up.  Abandon them to their fate and skedaddle.**
>
> That sounds wise.

# Premature Epilogue: Amira

>“I’ve hurt people, not because enemies stood between me and what I want, but because mercy stood between me and what I want.
>
>I’ve forsaken Sigmar’s blessings, not because they are from Sigmar, but because they are blessings.”

Amira’s conversion is not that she doesn’t believe in Sigmar’s ideals anymore - order and civilization - it’s that she still values those things, but has come to believe that betraying her values will get her closer to understanding what she wants to understand, and is sufficiently crazy at this point to go ahead with that.

(A true Malalite would convert, thereby betraying him, and become Unaligned, thereby self-destructively making themself an enemy of the powers that be and the world in general. But Amira doesn't quite have the right frame of mind to think of that.)

### Goals, plans

>“Any door might have a secret behind it, a fragment or a hint at the meaning of the greater Secret. And every person has secrets inside, that no one else knows. That’s why I carry a sword.”

The first thing we must imagine her doing is summoning the motorcycle again and disassembling it. Not because it’s a blessing from Sigmar, but because it’s a blessing, and that’s reason enough to destroy it.

(There could be a Cavalier / Blackguard progression... with her stealing a normal vehicle, and refusing to use divine bond out of spite.)

From there.. well, her goal is to understand the secret she learned.

Part of that is seeking forbidden knowledge. The kind of things justiciars are supposed to prevent people from finding out... which just means she knows where to look. Maybe tracking down associates of the person it was she learned the secret from.

The other part is destroying or abandoning anything that stops her from understanding it. At this point, she may see sanity as such an obstacle. She might go out of her way to burn bridges with her old life, or work against things she used to care about, believing that will get her closer to the truth.

Come to think of it, it’s almost reasonable that she might commandeer a ship and go back to Yehket - before she fell, she tried pretty hard to stop the necromancer from getting out to the rest of the wheel, and on top of that, it *might* know something about what she’s seeking.

Malal’s third commandment prohibits aiding others, but if you’re aiding a murderous undead sorcerer by helping them get at more potential victims, maybe that’s sufficiently screwing over everyone else for him to let it slide.

Another possible scheme would be if she hears about some specific gate or door that should not be opened, and latches on to the idea of seeing what’s through it. Previously, the compulsion to open things only came up when she was physically near them, and she had some restraint about it, but this is the villainous version of Amira, so...

# Session Four: Time to Murder a Religion
### From the logs of M'K'Splswap

## Scene 1: He Be Gee Bees

Finding their Popo Empire police officer hostages bizarrely uninterested in joining a pirate crew, the party dropped them off on some out-of-the-way moon. M'k played a rather hilarious prank regarding a disappearing gifted cloak, and Igneous gave them a report about Orobas with instructions “give it to someone who might do something about it”.  Then the crew were off towards Walimore, home of the space whale gods, there to kill one of them, should Vectron will it, which, well, duh. Lena, the fairy who'd started all this, had joined the party, despite their best efforts.

Something odd happened while navigating the Warp, leading to an outbreak of paranoia. Just about everyone on the ship thought that just about everyone else was plotting something horrible but nonspecific. Scarlett, affected first and most strongly, threatened to detonate the ship's mines, holding the rest of the crew hostage and unable to leave the bridge; luckily, Lena was able to sneak through the ventilation shafts and defuse the mine. Doktor ended up grappling with Scarlett, who struggled under the massive cybork to the point of exhaustion and finally unconsciousness.

The craziness seemed to spread, with Lena attempting to defuse the rest of the mines in fear of the rest pulling a Scarlett. Luckily, Captain Doktor, who was among the less affected, was able to realize that the recently-hired Redshirt Alta still seemed in possession of his faculties; Alta was appointed temporary Captain until sanity returned to the crew, or at least to Doktor Meetslab.

Sanity was indeed restored, at least to the party's questionable baseline, by the time we reached the Walimore portal relay. Exiting the Warp, we began to pick up radio chatter from a settlement we called Ork Zone. Ads for meat, along with something called "blood perfume", were as much enticement as was needed.

## Scene 2: Welcome to Ork Zone

With the Bumbling Mark parked at the edge of Ork Zone's bubble of atmosphere, an expeditionary force dropped to the surface: Doktor, Igneous, M'k, and Lena.

Things immediately got interesting as Doktor crash-landed into the dwelling of the local chief, Biggum. The two orks, both of comparably extreme size, squared up to fight, and Doktor uppercut his podunk counterpark right off of the asteroid. Regrettably, Doktor was not quite able to parlay that victory into leadership of the locals, but we were free to inquire about the whales.

In the local tavern, the party gleaned some information about Susie, the whale god who regenerated endlessly, and Ragna-GrogaMak, the whale of destruction who attacked Susie unceasingly and whom we had come to kill -- Lena had not had a preference as to which whale would die, but they had told M'k that Susie was the Vectron-follower of the two, and besides, the whale of chaotic destruction seemed the less preferable to leave alive and unchecked. However, this being an ork tavern, there were several brawls that first broke out and needed resolution: the bartender we had been questioning quickly got in a fight with one rando, besting him, after which another called M'k an Elf. M'k returned the insult, and found himself parrying an axe blow and driving his spear home; the impaled rando was impressed, and peace was restored.

We learned that the orks hunted Susie for bits of valuable flesh and that the whales would pass by Ork Zone soon, among other useful details. We hatched a plan to lure Ragna-GrogaMak with blood perfume and kill him with mines; to this end we headed to the Blood Perfumery, where Doktor cleverly distracted the shopkeep by fighting him until he was dead.

The perfume acquired, we waited until we saw the whales approach. One, Susie, vast and slow, and the other, Ragna-GrogaMak, smaller than the Bumbling Mark and comparably fast, whirling around Susie and clawing off hunks of flesh. Orks leapt to catch the valuable blubber, many being lost to the Astral Sea in the process. We leapt into action, except that it was more of a series of measured bounces into action, given the microgravity.

## Scene 3: Armbergrisly

Back in the Bumbling Mark, the team moved ahead of the whales and laid a trail of blood perfume, at the end of which we deployed all twenty-two remaining mines in a loose cluster.

As the whales approached, Igneous bowed to his urge to investigate, relying on his voidskin implant as he exited the airlock, attempting to send a camera drone down Ragna-GrogaMak's gullet.

The whale did not follow the trail of blood perfume.

Captain Doktor Meetslab ordered a ramming attack.

When we collided with the whale of destruction, Igneous was thrown free of the Mark, to his apparently certain doom. Stranded in vacuum, his voidskin running out of oxygen and with no shuttle to rescue him, Igneous disgorged a dangerous amount of explosive crystal from his bag of holding before climbing into the bag all but for one arm, which reached out of the bag and held a pistol -- his predictably insane plan being to explode himself back towards the airlock he had lost hold of, with the nearly impermeable artifact protecting him. His arm was vaporized instantly, but he had judged the angle nearly perfectly, and the bag of holding was bouncing neatly around the airlock as Alta rushed to retrieve it.

Scarlett, meanwhile, was at the helm as we faced a destructive million-pound cetacean chaos demiurge at point-blank range. Buttons and levers were pushed and pulled, respectively, as never before, and the Mark popped a U-ie in record time to beat Ragna-GrogaMak to the trap.

And, spoiler, it went right into the mines. Which went off. Boom, dead whale god. Except it was more of a minutes-long BOOOOOOM of twenty-two military-grade astral mines detonating simultaneously.

M'k spent a while staring at nothing and not saying much, but he was and is totally fine.

Our party snapped to their senses as they saw a variety of what are politely called astral anomalies as the structure of belief holding up Ragna-GrogaMak's existence was decapitated. Orks were sucked into the Warp as daemons appeared in their place, each daemon either snatching other orks back to the Warp or else proceeding to ravage the camp.

# Session Five: The Stolen Heart
### From the logs of M'K'Splswap

## Scene 1: Potluck

The Bumbling Mark hurtled towards the Walimore portal relay, away from the chaos of Ork Zone. Somehow, Lena snuck away from the ship, choosing for inscrutable fairy reasons to remain among the assailing daemons and hapless orks.

M'k decided this was the best time to summon a great store of luck from the Warp, which worked incredibly well, except that he was still unlucky while casting the spell, which released a burst of corrupting energy that spoiled nearly all of the ship's food, including the whale-god meat. Two days' worth of unspoilt rations remained.

M'k then spent the entirety of his significant magical luck on navigating a shortcut through the Warp, which he again announced was a great success, with surely a day at most remaining.

By the time thirty more hours had passed, the party feared that they were stranded far more deeply than they'd thought -- in time, if not, as M'k insisted, in space -- and began to plan drastic measures against starvation. Doktor Meetslab, characteristically bullheaded and drunk on notions of Captainly duty, insisted that he would sever his gigantic left arm, his only limb still made of living meat, asking that M'k attempt regenerate it afterwards (M'k explained that he didn't actually know those magics, but offered to give it "the old Vectron try"). Meetslab had practically started the procedure himself when his crew convinced him to let Igneous first attempt necrogastronomic rescue of the putrid alien blubber.

Igneous gave a long description of how he had determined which of the god-meat's ineffable theomolecular components could perhaps still be nutritious, as well as how he planned to isolate them. This description contained such words and phrases as "lipid", "aromatic profile", "water-soluble", and "centrifuge". Not knowing all of those presumably normal culinary terms, we let Igneous do his thing.

The end result, a grey and viscous sludge, was tentatively fed to our most durable member; Meetslab pronounced it edible, if awful, and we proceeded to sate our hunger, choking it down with queasy gusto, and settled to wait out the duration in buoyed spirits.

After our second large meal in which we gorged ourselves on sopping waves of bizarre ashen goop cut with scraps of space rat jerky and adamantine Orkish hardtack, Igneous excused himself from the table and wasn't seen for the rest of the day, and then for much of the next. Though he was eventually coaxed from his quarters, he continued to act oddly, making several disconcerting comments along the lines of destruction being the true nature of the universe.

## Scene 2: Ghost Town

We put this out of our minds as Centuria's portal array came at long last into view. Relieved to find nary a traffic robot on other side, let alone the Popo super-dreadnaught we'd feared, we puttered along to a world with little imperial presence, docking and emerging in the meager downtown of a small provincial city that somehow managed to be even emptier than it had looked on Wheelkipedia.

Igneous, still trickling blood from his stump arm but as flush with cash as the rest of us, quickly acquired and attached a serviceable bionic replacement, which he apparently preferred over letting M'k attempt to improvise regeneration of the original.

Doktor and M'k, meanwhile, went out to find medicine and drugs, as well as looking to bolster the ever-threadbare crew. They succeeded in finding bio-foam, failed at finding drive, and managed to sign one recruit, the roguish halfling Aephyr.

The three were interrupted in their return to the Mark by a nattily-dressed Tau; he gave the impression of being some sort of functionary, political or military or somewhere in between. He spoke charmingly but guardedly, revealing only his last name, Bond, and that he worked for the Glorious Tau Empire (hyperbolic appellation decidedly his). Tau Bond explained that the town had emptied in search of a key to an old Human Empire outpost, which had recently been stolen from something called a Keyhoarder by someone called Lexical Scribs, who had then fled taken to a certain ominously-named crystal sphere. This sphere, the Realm of Dust and Tears (!!!), was apparently quite close by, hence the gold rush. Bond had similar designs, but had been unable to secure transportation, and proposed that he would travel with us, that he would retrieve the key, and that the rest of us would receive a reward from the Glorious Tau Empire's outpost in the Centuria sphere.

By this time the party had regrouped at the Bumbling Mark, along with Aephyr and Bond. Hoping, Vectron willing, to at least acquire enough funds to upgrade our ship with actual weapons, we decided to join the hunt.

## Scene 3: Zip In, Unzip; or, Dust and Tears and Lust and Bears

We navigated to the Realm of Dust and Tears; not having been apprised that the sphere was a mere two kilometers in diameter, we overshot it entirely, continuing straight back into the Warp before coming around and in again. We had good positioning to perform an active augery, which identified a light frigate with two beings inside and another two running into it. We also saw a massively powerful heavy plasma cannon aboard the small Sultana-grade ship, along with a complement of murder servitors to render a boarding attempt nearly suicidal. Despairing of our chances if forced to fight unarmed in our wounded jalopy against this vessel, and seeing that we had been spotted, we very generously asked Vectron to bless their souls before Igneous and Tau began firing on the still-running pair, lest they contributed enough manpower to operate that cannon. Igneous flipped a switch on his extensively-modded lasgun and fired, dispatching one grotesquely, the distant form's arm seeming to practically evaporate. Tau dropped the second, who didn't get up, either dead or thoroughly stunned.

It was at this point that we spotted a dozen or so beings perhaps two hundred meters away from us, among them a giant stuffed bear, a matching slightly-less-giant octopus, and an imposing humanoid in a ten-gallon hat. Inferring that this was the rest of the crew whose members we had just attacked on somewhat less than unimpeachable grounds, we found ourselves embroiled in quite a more significant firefight than we'd anticipated.

Our melee team rushed forwards, M'k teleporting ahead and Doktor Meetslab thundering after, Aephyr riding piggy-back to shield himself from the gunfire that pocked Meetslab's skin like hail taking paint off an armored car. Aephyr probably would have been alright on his own: our opponents instinctively concentrated their fire on the gigantic, screaming ork. Energy weapons, automatic fire, and the occasional sharper crack of a high-powered rifle.

As Tau and Igneous started to pick off targets, Tau took a glancing shot to the back of the head, but recovered quickly, slurring, "Icantakeit". The pair searched behind them, which is to say they looked around the ship and glanced at the kilometer or so of hard, dusty, perfectly-flat, and obviously-empty desert. Wary, but with no better options, they resumed fire. Igneous flipped another switch, this one hot-glued to a nest of wires above his trigger guard, and pulled the trigger. The octopus exploded. Tau took his time aiming, then put a bullet through that ten-gallon hat, which dropped, along with its wearer, to the dust.

M'k, having crossed the distance in a handful of blinks, attempted diplomacy, our fire ceasing as M'k appeared in the line of fire with his hands in the air, them lowering weapons in response. Ten-gallon hat rose, unexpectedly alive, with a pained spasm, and identified himself as Captain Stern of the spelljammer BATNA. He was for some reason less than completely sanguine; our own captain soon caught up and took charge. Meetslab, M'k, and Aephyr stood in a row, facing down Stern, the nine-foot cloth bear, three redshirts, and one more man out of uniform, who wore a black cloak under a black wide-brimmed hat and carried an ancient-looking blunderbuss.

"Surrender your weapons and you ship, and will let you live."

"Not happening. You idiots. You have no idea what you've gotten yourselves into."

M'k chimed in, smiling without guile. "Winning a fight?"

"We've both suffered losses -"

"Yes", interjected Doktor, "You lost...eight men. I lost several of my best pimples." He looked himself over. "You must have shot a thousand rounds at me. But bygones can be bygones. We have bio-foam, which we will share as a gesture of good faith, if you will negotiate."

Stern nodded agreement, but our captain did not like what he saw in his counterpart's eyes.

"I must step away to talk to my crew. Perhaps some bio-foam we must reserve for our own."

Meetslab audibly requested a sitrep as he strode a dozen meters away, plotting a course that didn't impede our sharpshooters, then more quietly began assigning targets to be engaged on his command. As he returned, he suddenly broke into a sprint as he gave the designated signal at about two hundred decibels: "WAAAAAGH!"

The crew of the BATNA were clearly prepared for treachery, their weapons still at hand, but they were still staggered by the furious truckload of ork. All were too stunned to respond in time, except for one redshirt who was literally blinded by fear and defiance and who raised his weapon and fired, screaming, at random, unloading an entire magazine into his captain, killing the poor bastard for the second time that day.

Aephyr, viper-quick, relieved hat-and-cloak of his blunderbuss, while Tau and Igneous killed the final two redshirts with one shot apiece.

Captain Stern recovered again, his wounds having pinched shut, twitching as he slowly rose. Doktor lunged with his greathammer to put down the revenant before he could even stand, dealing another mortal blow.

The bear raised its hands, mirroring the disarmed sniper, and the violence stopped as quickly as it had started.

The enemy sniper, grizzled and ugly up close, proposed that he and "Patches" leave in their ship. We declined, and the sniper's weapons, blunderbuss and pistol, leapt to his hands before any of us could react; a classic M'k'sican standoff.

Stern lurched awake again. The enemy sniper aimed his pistol and killed him again, eyes and other weapon still trained on the rest of us.

Stern didn't stay down for a minute this time. His body was no longer regenerating, but flesh poured from his gaping wounds, bathtubs worth of grasping limbs and variaby ragged or flayed or scaly or razor-sharp skin.

The bear, Patches, started running.

The rest of us hacked away at legs and tentacles and wings, making little progress, until Aephyr tore open a gaping wound near where Stern's chest had been. Doktor waded into the now meters-wide living morass, reaching into the gap where the torrent was fiercest. He struggled, using all his strength, and pulled loose a still-beating heart made of a metal that hurt to look at. The mountain of flesh went still.

After we paused to react to that with dumbfounded silence, the sniper again suggested that he be allowed to leave in his ship. We stared at each other.

Our own sniper team could see all this, and Igneous commed in to say that they had a shot, asking whether they should hold fire. Doktor kept quiet; it took one shot each from Tau and Igneous, and we were alone, watching Patches escape.

M'k magically hailed the bear, suggesting that he should stop and negotiate or else be cut down as well. This had the desired effect, but the bear was still reticent; he wouldn't join our crew, and he wouldn't give us the codes needed to access the BATNA and disable the servitors.

The party began to discuss options, but drew silent as Tau Bond walked slowly towards the patchwork beast, straightening his posture and smoothing his hair.

The two were just out of earshot, and wouldn't say anything after, but we clearly heard the words, "Hey, baby, what's ursine?", followed at length by the sound of a heavy-duty zipper, revealing a human dollomancer within.

Patches returned, arm in arm with Tau, and gave us the keys to our new ship: the BATNA.
The people we killed conveniently left a bunch of explosives that we used to blow up the entrance of the temple. We left Patches in charge of looking out for the ship.

# Session Six: Scenes of Devastation
### From the logs of Doktor

Inside we found a somewhat chaotic scene. 

Our target, Lexical Scribs was there, along with several dead soldiers, killed by a Capuchin Buccaneer Monkey. As we were subduing the Simian, our target, Lexical Scribs, panicked about something horrible being released. A tank emerged, inside it was the adorable Octocat, who Charmed Doktor Meetslab with her mind magic. Doktor Meetslab, having decided that she was the cutest thing he had ever seen, made her part of the crew, and allowed her to ride on his shoulder. 

The monkey was easily dispatched, and Scribs was captured. Morty interrgated Skribs, and intimidated him so well that Scribs was driven insane and knocked unconscious from the shock. So he was hauled back to the ship to be dealt with later. 

The crew delved ever deeper in search for loot. And they found a stupid, horrible, ugly, disgusting, THIEVING FUCKING HAFLING. Who stole MY AMULET. WAAAAAAAAGH!

Ahem. I meant to say that we had an encounter with the famed "Thief of the Stars." The perceptive Octocat spotted this Hafling as he was rifling through our stuff. We immediately attacked him. Morty and Meetslab both got the drop on him, Meetslab throwing a knife at him and Morty tackling him to the ground. But it was for nought, he was too fast. Before Octocat could... befriend him, he escaped by jumping into a screen. 

He seemed to posses the peculiar ability to traverse the umbra, exiting and entering through shiny, reflective surfaces. 

There was some panic, after which the crew contacted their ship to make sure everything was ok. Turned out the thief had been seen on the ship and jumped into a mirror. There was some panic as we ran back to the ship, but it amounted to nothing. The thief had vanished. 
We keep looting, Octocat found a belt for herself along with three feather tokens: Boat, Anchor and Tree. 

Morty found an odd box. He picked it up and upon touching it he felt his blood attempting to leave his body. Thinking quickly, he chopped off the hand that had touched the box before the effect had spread to the rest of his body. The chopped off hand shriveled up and became a lizard hand, for Morty was in truth a lizardman disguising himself as human leaders.

Deciding that the worst had past, Morty then opened the box, activating a magical trap that he failed to resist. Morty was paralyzed and his sight and hearing was replaced by some sort of human music video on repeat. 

Not that the crew could tell, as far as they knew, Morty had simply been incapacitated, so he was hauled back to the ship to be deal with later. Inside the box he opened we found Helvetica's Irrevocably Advancing Marble. A marble that once activated was supposedly unstoppable.

Meanwhile Lexical Scribs came to, and was interrogated by Tau Bond. Lexical had gone quite mad, raving of conspiracies and whatnot, and was quite uncooperative. However Octocat was able to assist by... befriending Scribs, who at the command to 'reveal' revealed everything. The key we were looking for was a priestess Tarot card covered in blood. 

The card somehow functions as a portable portal. When the card is damaged, any who have spilled their blood upon it within a small radius around it are immediately teleported to the lost human outpost.

Meanwhile meanwhile, Meetslab had an encounter with the Keyhoarder himself, a humanoid of indeterminate race that had accumulated many keys to Sigil doors. He asked for Lexical Scribs and the card, but Meetslab didn't know about any of this yet. The Keyhoarder left back to Sigil through a door by reciting "open sesame"

Doktor Meetslab was presented with a choice to attempt to follow him, returning to Sigil, and potentially, to his old life. He eventually decided against it, as leaving his crew would be irresponsible of him.

As they left they took the opportunity to test the marble, finding out that it was, indeed, impossible to stop once it started moving. Walls posed no obstacle whatsoever, as it merely bored through them without slowing. It's irrevocable advancability was put to the ultimate test when it was launched towards the crystal sphere they had just left. It didn't slow. The crystal sphere moved with the marble, meaning the crew now had access to a truly world altering power. 

The crew left in both ships. Awkwardly, they only had one navigator between them, so they had to connect the ships via tow cables. They traveled to Centuria to collect their reward, however, something terrible had happened. The Necromancer Orobas had found his way to Centuria, and had caused there to be an apocalyptic amount of zombies everywhere. Seeing Centuria as a lost cause, the crew quickly scooped up as many civilian crew as they could carry and made way to Sparrow's Peak...

# Session Seven: Zombies and Demons
### From the logs of Doktor

We found ourselves once again facing the would be familiar sights of Centuria. Would be. It seemed an old problem had come to haunt us. The Necromancer Orobas had found his way to Centuria, wreaking an unbelievable amount of havoc by starting a zombie apocalypse on the surface. 

I admit I felt somewhat responsible for the havoc he was wreaking. I both released him and failed to put him down. As we entered the system we heard a message that had been playing every hour on the hour. A message from our old friend Amira. She had revealed that Orobas was a Lich and that his phylactery was the amulet that the Thief of Stars had stolen from me. 

A thought occurred. I asked Octocat, and apparently lichs regenerate next to their phylacteries. I don't know when I stopped smiling.

Through hailing people on the surface we found Orobas's last known location. The city was scanned, and an enormous spike of necromantic energy was found in a structure made from undead corpses. It was time to inaugurate the big gun. 

In order to get the best possible shot, I put someone in charge of the ship who had some skill in shooting guns: Dewey Scrubs. Acting captain Dewey Scrubs assisted Tau Bond in firing the unwieldy Cannon. It missed the first time anyway, glassing a nearby neighborhood. The next shot hit the mark, obliterating the tower. However, between our shots, Orobas had tried to escape in a getaway vehicle. He foolishly hailed us, I don't know what he said, as I flipped him off before hanging up. The third shot finished him off, letting him be that hafling's problem instead. All in all a pretty good day, we don't really have a lead yet on the whole human outpost thing, but that can wait. I want us to help out here a bit.

#### Captain's log, date: 4
We've been moving refugees to the less zombie infested areas. Me and the crew have established safe areas via kill teams, by shooting at zombies from the Batna's shuttles. 

So far so boring, will update tomorrow.

####Captain's log, date: 5
More of the same, refugees were pretty happy to be rescued. Couldn't look them in the eye.

I find killing zombies to be a very relaxing activity, like mowing the lawn, if the lawn could fight back.

####Captain's log, date: 6
We have more safe places now, without Orobas to direct the zombies they seem sort of aimless. 

Tau agent has been getting restless. Asked around for maps. Got a map that, for some reason that eludes me, leads from here to Baator. Who could possibly need a map like that? In any case the man also led us to a map repository where we could find actually useful maps. Guarded by tigers apparently. 

I ordered a stealth team to infiltrate the building and retrieve as many maps as they could find. Of course, of the three of them one of them fucks it up and we fight a bunch of tigers. Well I say fight, they didn't lay a paw on us as we utterly massacred them with a couple of grenades.

I almost attacked the mass of scrolls that approached me, before realizing that Octocat was buried in the middle of them. It was cute.

We're considering our options now, we have many travel options now, including a way to Sigil if we can get to Arcadia. I'll have to put a pin on it though, we still have a job to do.

#### Captain's log, date 7
We discussed it among ourselves. The only bit of Tau civilization that the Agent was aware of was in Elysium, but we lacked a map to go there, making the trip dangerous.

On the other hand, the option remains to try to go to the human outpost ourselves, see what we find. The concern is becoming stranded, as we might teleport there only to find ourselves with no means of returning. The solution was to bring a ship with us, but the only way to do that was to find a ship that bleeds. 

The Bastion of Blissful Joy has such a ship.

#### Date 8: Sick of Warp travel, told Mik to take a shortcut. 

#### Date 9: Smooth sailing all around. 

#### Date 10: Talked to Alta. He hasn't been to Sigil, I told him it's nothing special, but he insists he wants to see it. I told him my boss would want to see me, it's been a long bathroom break so far. 

#### Date 11: Tried to cook, still not very good, I got yelled at to not waste the stock of food like that.

#### Day 16: Stared out the window for a while. It's weird how every section of the Warp looks very different and yet the same.

#### Day 21: Cramped my arm exercising. Gotta find some way to transplant my soul into a robot body. 

#### Day 23: Igneous is still esconded in his room, I asked him what he was doing and he tried to explain, but it all went over my head. 

####Day 24: You know, I was pretty sure it was smooth sailing up until it wasn't. 

Freaking hell. Too many things happened at once. I felt something trying to influence my mind, and judging by the looks on the rest of the crew, so did they. 

The Tau agent, Aephyr and Octocat were all affected, along with several crew members. The only one's unaffected were myself, Mik, Alta and to my utter amazement, Dewey Scrubs. What a hero. 

The rest were filled with happiness and bliss and that sensation you get where everything just seems to be going alright. 

A perfectly fine attitude to have. When we're not being attacked by demons. I didn't mention the demons yet, did I? Yeah, we had daemons on the BATNA. How many? I had no clue. At first I thought it was just the one, some crab monster that we dispatched with our only Krak Grenade and a couple of hammer swings.

I got scratched a bit, but it was fine. I then get a call from engineering that something has killed three crew! So I run there, carrying Mik for support. I try to get a hold on the situation, asking what other daemons were aboard. Several afflicted crew were indisposed by a cuddly cat Daemon in the mess hall, and one crew had gotten killed by something crawling in the goddamn vents!

The monster in Engineering is easily dispatched. I'm pretty sure Mr. Tau got in a fight with the vent monster, judging by the claw marks on his face. He tried to hug the damn thing and I emphatically commanded him to shoot it and to my enormous relief I head the gunshots over the combeads. Apparently at some point in all this chaos we entered the Materium, so many crew were indisposed that piloting the ship had become difficult and couldn't avoid the planetoid we found ourselves hurtling towards. Dewey ordered us to brace for impact, I held Mik and dug my fingers in the floor plate. 

Whatever hope I held of controlling the situation fell by the wayside as we started venting Plasma when the impact broke something important. Truly desperate, me and Mik attempted to fix the problem, we failed, I don't know what knob I broke and apparently those cables Mik was tugging on were coolant cables. Thankfully I could get Aephyr in there and coaxed him into making emergency repairs. 

That problem solved, I decided to go to the mess hall to sort out whatever mess was waiting for me there. Over the intercom I could hear Dewey asking for people to man the main Arcana console, I don't know what happened with that, I left Mik to handle that.

The mess hall contained a creature much bigger then I was expecting, and much less cuddly. It slammed me once in between me fucking ending it with my hammer.

So I'm hoping the worst is dealt with. I'm wrong, because of course I fucking am. The feeling of hope has started ringing mental alarm bells, warning me that something horrible is about to happen. Aephyr had opened the airlocks after my crew sent some very worrying messages over the coms. So I run towards the airlock.

I'm still not sure what I saw. Besides the happy looking lizard people with fishbowls on their heads. What was next to them was something called a Greater Daemon. 

The moment I saw it I could feel it trying to worm into my brain, to make me feel happy. If that thing thought it was going to force me to feel anything it was painfully naïve. Transcendental bliss? Try Axiomatic Spite. I grab Aephyr and Tau and get them the hell away from it, bring them to Mik and tell him to hold onto them for dear life and to not let them leave his sight, then turn around to run back to the airlock, I still had a Daemon to sort out.

I charge it, swinging at it with my hammer, but it doesn't feel right. It keeps trying to make me happy, I make myself miserable and angry out of spite. I opened the airlock and tossed it out with all my strength, closing it behind me and telling Dewey to get us the hell away from that thing. 

Finally. Finally, I had managed to regain control of the situation. I had got three seconds into calming down until I remembered we had a second ship. We attempt to contact them but there's no response. When we go over via shuttles, we find that the ship is nowhere to be found, tow cables broken. 

I wanted to feel bad about losing an entire spelljammer and the crew inside it, including Tau's boy toy. I really did, but at that point it was one less thing to worry about. 

The crew had calmed down by then, except for the Tau'va agent, but we'll get to that. And I'm not sure about Octocat, but honestly, she always like that so it's hard to tell.

There was still the cuddle-creature in the mess hall. I briefly considered keeping it, but I could immediately tell by the looks on the five crew that had glued themselves to it that this was going to be a problem. So I pried my crew off it and killed it. The rest were upset, but I wasn't going to have that thing on my ship. 

Control was reestablished, the BATNA was put on a stable orbit around the Bastion, while I gave each of the dead crew a 'jammer's burial.

I called a crew meeting because my day still wasn't done. I talked to the Tau. He was compromised, but not to an extent where I needed to kick him off the ship. Part of the Daemon has latched on to him, permanently altering his personality. I could tell it was still mostly him though, so the alteration wasn't too major. He also said something about gaining new powers, so we'll see where that leads.

Next was getting a space whale. We went with diplomacy this time, I let the Tau, Octocat and Aephyr handle the negotiations. We struck a deal where we would borrow the whale and leave the BATNA as colateral. 

And here I am, on our third 'ship'. My crew has yet to inform me of the full specs of this thing, but it lacks a shield and I'm pretty sure it's unarmed, so that's a downside. But whatever. I'm really tired right now and if you don't mind I'm going to take this lovely vial of Comfort sitting on my desk and lay face down in my bed.

# Interlude: On the Nature of Ridable Space-Whales
### From the notes of Igneous

There are many species of space-whale in the universe.  When not twisted by the psionic power of a worshipful orc village, they range in intelligence from dog-like to super-human.

Some of the humanish intelligence space whales have joined the Omnissian church and enhanced themselves with bionics.  They find mechadendrites extremely useful given their lack of fingers.  They also developed a new bionic implant: a socket into which standard ship modules can be hot-plugged.  Some even implanted geller-fields, though the need to stare directly into the warp with their native senses often drove them insane.  (Space whales' primary senses are vision and a sonar variant using ontology waves,)

A handful of tech-priests thought the insanity problem could be solved by installing the same bionics on non-sapient space whales.  This seemed to work.  There are many ethical issues, which caused the Prime Omnissian Church to exile the practitioners, but Omnissiah Himself has not smmitten them.  They continue to publish in the Journal of Practical Astrocetology, which Igneous skimmed to decide if it was a good place to publish his own recent case study.  The article caught his attention, mostly because of the Omnissian schism.

Compared to conventional ships, nonsapient bionic space whales have some advantages.  Their ontological sonar is more detailed than a standard active augary, and their tough leathery skin heals from damage at an extraordinary rate.  They also have some disadvantages.  They are not perfectly obedient, and may require Animal Ken checks to calm or control.  Similarly, they can be effected by enchantments, which shield do not block.

(Space squid also exist, but if you put a Geller Field on a nonsapient space squid and take it into the warp, it ends up possessed by Slaanesh.  No one knows why.)

# Session Eight: Human Gory
### From the logs of M'K'Splswap

## Scene 1: Baleen Out

It had taken weeks to recover from our wounds -- mostly Aephyr's -- but finally the time had come to travel by blood-stained Tarot card to an ancient Human outpost located who-knows-where and filled with who-knows-what, borne in the belly of an astral whale not so different from the one we'd recently butchered. As reasonable as that sounds, there was nonetheless a sense of apprehension; we checked and re-checked our voidsuits, some of which had been provided by the eager bliss-lizards who temporarily made up the bulk of our crew. We didn't know exactly what we'd find.

Whale-ships don't have artificial gravity, so we floated through the beast's gaping maw like Djon Ah did in the Second Book of Vectron, our redshirts behind us. Two-meter-wide tubes snaked around organs big enough to host a game of ultra-cricket, leading us to the bridge. We could hear the thumping of a giant heart, the churning of ichor, and the skittering of rust monsters just outside the tubes, which were made of plastic, given the rust monsters.

A close thaumaturgical analysis of the card had indicated that it would carry everyone who was touching it when it was torn, along with everyone in a radius that would be greater the more violently the card was destroyed. Once the blood samples, collected from whale and crew, had been carefully mixed and applied to the card, we huddled around. Aephyr took point, slashing wildly at the card, some bizarre halfling artistry ensuring that the damage would all be done at once.

There was a sickening lurch, pulling in every direction, though most didn't seem to feel it. Igneous staggered, and M'k frowned, having felt us arrive in a crystal sphere and then immediately leave it.

When we saw the sphere behind us, we realized why we had been ejected: it was scarcely ten meters wide. Active augury showed nothing else nearby, not even a portal relay, which was unsettling. We'd need to find another way to leave.

First, though, we needed to get in. Hoping that the sphere was bigger on the inside, we set our entire crew to the task of spelljamming into the sphere and staying there. We failed repeatedly, each time ejected after the briefest moment.

M'k, who by his nature and training saw and felt the warp more intimately, sensed (as he later explained) that he could choose to stay within the sphere, and so he did, hoping the rest would join him.

They did not.

## Scene 2: [Unintelligible]

While the others fretted over how to join him, wondering who was more boned than whom if they couldn't, M'k found himself in a circular room, perhaps ten meters wide (not a good sign), staring at his own body. After briefly considering the advantages of discorporation, and then weighing them against never being able to finally drink that expensive brandy Aephyr had been saving, he decided to reach out, straining as far as he could, and reinhabit his flesh-sack. It was a close thing.

Suddenly his senses were returned, and he heard a loud alarm, punctuated by a recording in what was probably ancient Human, and saw a room filled with various types of utterly bewildering technology, which is to say, technology. There were lots of screens and lots of buttons, several large glass tubes (showers?) with ancient Human labels, and a thick layer of dust covering everything. Scattered papers, though also unreadable, displayed figures and drawings, some of which looked worrisomely daemonic. Claws, horns, and patches of evil-looking hide, carefully sketched.

The human station also lacked artificial gravity, and so the "ceiling" looked much like the floor. More tables, more tech.

There was also, in the center of the room, a pillar, which slid partially open at M'k's approach to reveal a ladder leading both up and down. Peering in either direction, M'k's view was obscured by the back of his own head. This was one of *those* spheres. A light breeze, no doubt from the ventilation system which (thank Vectron!) was still quietly humming, blew "upwards", though at this point "up" and "down" were arbitrary labels.

The recording was now alternating with another. M'k had been on spelljammers long enough to guess that they meant something along the lines of, "Everything is fucked, and someone should do something about it."

When one of the tubes started to blink and beep and whir, M'k guessed that it was a stasis tube containing that Someone. Not wanting to see what the mysterious tube-dweller would Do About It, M'k made himself scarce, ducking "down" through the hatch, which is to say upwind. That would get confusing.

M'k took the first exit from the access tunnel, the tube again sliding one-third open at his touch, and was nearly telefragged by the BATNA's shuttle, which had been loaded into the whale as a precaution. Out stepped Doktor, Igneous, Aphyr, Scarlett, and Dewey Scrubs. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, apart from Igneous, who just said, "Ooh, the engineering room!" and wandered off.

Our captain explained that they had made their way in by carefully timing the shuttle's exit from the whale, which he could barely believe had worked. Doktor looked less relieved when he was informed that an inhabitant of the station was perhaps about to wake up; we decided to be there when they did, and climbed back..."up". "Downwind". "Back", anyway.

The tube was still beeping. Igneous cleared some of the dust, pulled out a flashlight, and pressed face and light against the glass. The nude figure inside was very muscular, for a human. Familiar enough with the technology to ignore the unreadable labels, Igneous declared that several key "defrost/decant" systems were not functioning; we decided to ask Igneous to reactivate them. No sense letting the guy get brain damaged, if we might need his help to leave.

The tube opened several minutes later, with us waiting in a semicircle around it. Aephyr, our best talker, stood front and center, flanked by our humans, Dewey and Alta, for the comfort of our host. Doktor didn't even have his greathammer raised all the way.

The human didn't stumble, barely tremored as he woke from what must have been thousands of years of sleep, though his eyes were wide as he took us in. He spoke.

Yeah, knowing ancient Human really would have been useful.

We responded in Trade: the human was nonplussed. We went through every other language we knew, with similar results. Aephyr tried Draconic last, though it should have been obvious that such an ancient language was our best shot, and finally the human replied, in what Aephyr described as, "The most dogshit-broken Drac I've ever heard".

We muddled through a conversation, Aephyr pausing before each utterance to confer with the rest of us, the human answering rapidly and with inscrutable intensity. The gist seemed to be that he thought that the station had been breached, not just by us, but by *Baator*. We thought it was probably just us, but, damn, better safe than sorry.

We offered to help, and for the first time he looked hesitant.

"...human glory?"

"Yes", we said.

## Scene 3: Immovable Object

Our butt-naked host gestured us back down the hatch, silently insisting on bringing up the rear. This was not a great sign, but we put Doktor last; he was certainly the most durable person in the room. We passed engineering, then another few doors, until butt-naked indicated another room.

"Butt-naked" isn't great. We'll call him "Karen". Alta said that's a human name.

M'k, leading the way, activated the palm thingy, and we filed into what was clearly the armory.

Karen grabbed a flak jacket already laden with several grenades on the left breast, as well as, near the right hip, a gigantic holstered revolver -- bigger than any hand-cannon we'd ever seen. He grabbed an assault rifle for good measure, then hit a button.

A section of floor hinged down to form a ramp. We followed Karen down to the next floor, which featured several machine-gun turrets pointed towards the room's centerpiece: a black vertical disk, as tall as the room. It looked like the iris of a camera.

Karen looked...mildly...surprised? Disappointed? Relieved?

All of those, but also somewhat, M'k thought, like he was about to try to kill all of us.

M'k whispered this to the rest of the party just as Karen shot a rocket from his ridiculous revolver, straight into Doktor Meetslab's face.

I'm not sure what that was meant to accomplish, but, whatever, right? We had this guy outnumbered. Igneous, the glorious bastard, managed to shoot the revolver right out of Karen's hand, obviously damaging it.

Karen pulled a grenade even as he readied his assault rifle.

Aephyr decided to swap the grenade out without Karen noticing, because halflings are nearly as crazy as goblins. But Aephyr, and Vectron damn it I still haven't forgiven him for this, Aephyr decides the best replacement would be a bottle of brandy. An empty bottle. So even as he's sprinting towards Karen, who by the way is still wearing nothing but a flak jacket and an angry scowl, Aephyr chugs THE ENTIRE BOTTLE. That stuff was from year 184-Fλ-Rhombus! They don't make brandy like that any more! Not to mention that the guy weighs a buck-nothing and doesn't even drink; I then thought our only likely casualty would be from alcohol poisoning.

So, OK, Aephyr pulled it off perfectly. Karen didn't even see him, didn't even look as he expertly tossed his "grenade" at Igneous' feet while aiming his assault rifle, again at Doktor. Some people never learn.

By this point a few of us have shot at Karen, but didn't seem to hit anything vital.

M'k realizes something is wrong when he teleports behind Karen and spears him in the back of the knee. Right in the PCL. Karen buckles, but the spear doesn't go through. Doesn't even scratch him. No blood.

Aephyr then put a phase sword through that flak jacket. *Tink.* Nothing.

Who tanks a fucking phase sword? Suddenly this didn't look easy.

Doktor reached the fray and tried blunt force, landing a big hit with his greathammer. Karen sprawled, but still looked unharmed. Doktor pounced, pinning the human on the floor. If he even was human.

Our captain, still winning the grapple because thank Vectron the ancient exhibitionist wasn't as strong as he was durable, pulled a krak grenade, shoving it into Karen's mouth and holding his jaw shut. That would have to kill him.

It didn't even hurt him.

We started getting creative. M'k tried to shove his Rod of Immobility down the Karen's throat, hoping to at least immobilize him, but that proved to be pretty tricky.

M'k was still failing at this when the second ancient human showed up. This one was gracile and graceful, even beautiful, for a human. His sweat pants and camo vest looked like a runway model's vaguest gesture towards tactical gear, and he carried a pistol. We'll call him Jen; that's another human name.

Remember how Igneous had just shot a gun out of someone's hand? Well, Jen dodged Igenous' next shot like he wasn't even trying. At the same time, he practically danced over and slapped something onto Igenous' long las, which the goblin dropped as though an ancient human had just put an explosive on it. Jen's ridiculously overpowered ability seemed to involve dodging.

M'k having turned his attention to Jen, Doktor switched gears and started strangling Karen, just like Vectron did when the skin of the Namekian Mechalion could not be pierced.

Igneous rolled away from his long las, which exploded. He reached into his bag of holding, a
look of horror passing across his face as he rummaged for long seconds. He set his jaw and
settled for the lasgun slung across his back.

It was disheartening to see a third human show up. It also made us wonder what our redshirts were up to; Dewey and Scarlett had stayed in the tube room. But more importantly, another ancient terror with (presumably) another impossible power. We'll call this one Ben. Yeah, Alta tells a lot of stories about humans. Anyway, Ben was female, dark-haired, and also comely by human standards. She was nude, carrying nothing but a pair of flight goggles.

Ben was putting on the goggles as she descended the ramp, and adjusting them as she approached the ongoing wrestling match between Karen and Meetslab, which in hindsight was the most confusing part of the entire fiasco, because the goggles were instantly destroyed when she reached the scuffle and exploded.

She exploded, but she wasn't harmed, just like the Exploding Bush in the First Book of Vectron. She began to try to peel Doktor off of her comrade. Meetslab, still diligently strangling, was enough ork for both of them, of course, and barely harmed by the explosion, so then it was the three of them careening around the room, bouncing between the floor-ceiling and the ceiling-floor.

(You didn't forget that this was all in zero-g, right?)

We heard screams from above, distorted by echoes. Familiar screams. Scarlett and Dewey were still alive!

Jen, who'd been posing seductively while dodging fire from Aephyr and Igneous and also keeping them pinned behind cover, and also simultaneously dodging spears from M'k while chipping away at his mage armor, chose this moment to extend his arm lazily backwards, literally not even looking, and take a shot at Aephyr.

These guys were crazy powerful, but it was this moment of arrogance that turned the tide of the fight. Jen might have been the dodgiest waif on the wheel, but Aephyr was a halfling's halfling's halfling, and he was just barely able to twist away from the shot, contorting himself absurdly in mid-air.

The shot hit Ben instead. In the face. So, good news: Ben was not invincible, even if she wasn't harmed by her own explosions. More good news: Ben seemed to be blinded, her eyes damaged by either the bullet itself or the pieces of orbital bone it had dislodged.

Bad news: Ben apparently reacted to bad news by exploding even harder. At point-blank range, even Meetslab (still throttling Karen) was wounded; across the room, the shockwave briefly knocked out M'k's armor, the ensuing fireball wrapping him in third-degree burns.

(Though he'd seen the blast coming, M'k hadn't been able to teleport behind cover fast enough. M'k had never failed to teleport anywhere. Ever. This would need to be remedied.)

(From above, we heard an extremely deep roar, followed by crashes and sounds of tearing metal, followed by a familiarly squeaky scream. "There's a dragon up here!")

Aephyr was grievously wounded by the blast, but halfings are indomitable, particularly when they just drank ALL OF OUR BEST LIQUOR YOU MONSTER. Ahem. Aephyr leaped towards Jen, phase sword in hand. Jen fired another barely-aimed shot, but this time Aephyr was ready, using our PRICELESS MAGICAL MARBLE to block the bullet, which he placed in his pocket because halflings are kleptomaniacs when they're sober and just ridiculous when they aren't.

Jen dodged away, of course, but Igneous saw his chance, pinning him to the floor with a web too wide to be dodged.

M'k, finally able to turn his focus from Jen, saw Ben closing her eyes and pursing her lips, looking very much like she was about to explode again. He put a spear through her shoulder and deep into her chest. She stopped looking like that.

And then Dewey showed up, sprinting down the ramp with terror on his face and what looked like a warp grenade in each white-knuckled fist. What a guy! Holy shit, had he already taken the pins out?

Doktor, still squeezing the neck of a nearly docile Karen, asked where Scarlett was.

"Scarlett's dead, sir!"

"Get rid of those fucking warp grenades!"

Dewey was so bewildered that he almost dropped the grenades at his own feet.

"Up the ramp, you idiot!"

We scrambled to the room's periphery as the grenades soared upwards and bounced mercifully out of sight. We saw a glimpse of orange scales and orange flames peeking around the gap between floors, but then the grenades went off, spewing sparks and black clouds and strange bugs and other warpy things, and we heard a cacophony of warpy howls and shrieks, and then we heard something that sounded very much like a dragon being sucked unwilling into the warp.

Warp grenades are terrifying, but you have to admit they're pretty damned cool.

Unfortunately, the blast kept coming. A wave of rotting, freezing fire, bright and scintillating octarine to M'k but pitch black to everyone else, roared down the ramp and across the battlefield.

Igneous was behind cover, and Doktor simply took the hit.

M'k let his armor absorb the worst of the blast, his eyes on Aephyr. The halfling's armor was in tatters, his flesh was torn and bloody beneath, and he had looked like he might die even before being engulfed by magical not-fire. M'k was still angry about the brandy, but this anger gave way to insight. Aside from his wounds, Aephyr was by now thoroughly, dangerously drunk, and a raging bender had been known to deepen M'k's own connection to the warp.

As the flames rolled over him, M'k willed a message into Aephyr's mind.

"Steal it."

Aephyr didn't need magic to wordlessly reply, "What?"

"Steal it. You'll die otherwise. Believe you can steal it, and STEAL IT."

Aephyr put on his most confident grin, backflipped to where the brandy bottle lay, cartwheeling as he picked it up, and caught the reality quake inside the empty half-pint.

He stoppered it.

Aephyr stumbled over to Jen and prepared to pour the bottle of torn reality right back out over the human. At our shouts of dismay, Aephyr shrugged one shoulder, furrowed his brow in concentration, managed to shrug both shoulders, and simply stabbed Jen in the throat.

We turned to our captain, who was still squeezing the neck of a limp Karen.

"There is still a pulse. Give me the Rod, M'k. Aephyr, give me the Marble." *And if you block another bullet with an irreplaceable magic item of sphere-shifting power, I will throw you out of an airlock*, Doktor was able to convey through body language alone.

Doktor loosened his grip just long enough to shove the Rod nearly two-thirds of the way down the invincible human's throat. This was much easier now that he was sleeping like a big naked blood-soaked baby.

Doktor placed the Marble in Karen's mouth, pressing it against the palate. "Go get 'em."

For half a second, Karen's tissues merely stretched. Then there was a sound like a spelljammer being torn in half by a black hole, and the human's skull split messily into exactly two pieces, an irregular disk of bone and scalp carrying with it a portion of brain. Doktor retrieved the Marble from a perfectly Marble-shaped hole in said brain.

Captain Meetslab paused to check for a pulse before pocketing the Marble and returning the Rod.

"...Captain?"

We turned to Dewey, whose uniform still bore a few patches of burning ice.

"...did I just kill a dragon...?"

"Yes. We are very proud of you...Lance Corporal Dewey Scrubs."

## Scene 2: Marble and Rod

Scarlett's tragic death notwithstanding, we were all pretty jazzed about being alive and in possession of some new toys, apart from Igneous, who had somehow lost almost everything in his bag of holding. I'd warned him: I once had an uncle who liked to sleep in one of those things, and when it malfunctioned, they had needed to bury him in it. We had no idea what had happened in this case, though. The Thief of Stars? Who knew.

Igneous consoled himself by examining Karen's corpse. It was no longer utterly invincible, but it was still durable beyond all reason. Igneous packed it away, with plans to make leather armor out of the skin (gross) and to try to engineer more of the same. M'k made himself an extremely durable Arcane Eye.

We wrapped Scarlett's corpse, which was covered in what tasted like dragon saliva; Igneous glared at M'k and took a sample the normal way. Scarlett would get a 'jammer's burial.

Doktor Meetslab decided to open the jar containing a living mustache. "It looks friendly", he said, "And besides, it really seems to want me to. It looks impatient."

Before we could unpack that, the mustache was already skittering up our captain's arm on long, insectile legs.

Doktor had gone from looking apprehensive to panicked by the time the mustache reached his lip and plunged those legs deep into the flesh of his face. He shrieked like a little girldarin as he tugged gingerly on the beastling, but it was anchored securely.

We told him to leave it, sir. It looked great, sir. Very...imposing. Commanding. Regal. Sir.

(The mustache seemed to emit a magical aura of command, but it didn't seem to be affecting Meetslab himself, so we figured it was probably ok. It was a magnificent mustache, after all.)
We examined the iris disk, which we figured to be some sort of portal and probably the reason for the whole station's existence. Black runes on its base stood out as later additions, not matching the aesthetics or construction of the rest.

Igneous and Aephyr examined the runes, identifying the language as Infernal. Igneous was able to start poking around the magical machinery of the disk, humming to himself as he made steady progress at figuring out the purpose of the setup.

A few minutes into this, Igneous went very still. He told the rest of us to back up, in a strangled voice, as he did the same, very slowly and carefully.

Apparently this device had been modified to hijack someone else's portal connection. Igneous had traced that connection to Baator, which was somewhat expected, given the Infernal runes and the fact that Karen had feared invasion from Baator. What was truly horrifying was that the portal seemed to lead directly to the lair of Azmodeus himself: Igneous had recognized the portal connection as that which the King of Devils was said to personally use for the capture of unwilling souls.

Time to fucking go, then. We still didn't know how we'd accomplish our escape. Nobody wanted to listen to M'k's suggestion, however many times he made it.

Igneous went through more of the station's systems, prying open panels, splicing wires, plugging thingies into whatsits, and furiously tapping at keypads as though the devil himself were about to burst in, which of course was exactly what we feared.

At some point he found an access hatch leading to the level that had been sealed off, with no entrance from the access tube. We'd previously found that the floor on either side of that level was suspiciously thick and solid. It turned out that the entire level was filled with explosives; with the thick metal floors, it formed a shaped charge pointed at the portal, capable of destroying the entire station instantly.

Sensible.

M'k suggested, again, that we escape the sphere by popping it from the inside. Immobilize the Rod on one side of the sphere, set the Marble moving away from it on the other side...the velocities of the two artifacts when activated were, as far as we could tell, utterly fixed. The worst that could happen would be that nothing would happen, should the sphere prove stronger than the artifacts.

Igneous explained with pained patience that popping the sphere wouldn't help, because then we'd be stranded in the Astral Sea with no portal relay, and then we'd die slowly of starvation.

He further explained that the worst-case scenario was not that nothing would happen, but that breaking the sphere would cast us directly into the Warp.

Igneous then took out a pencil and notepad to show with math that we would, in fact, almost certainly be cast into the Warp if we tore a hole in reality the size of even the smallest crystal sphere.

He stopped mid-sentence, breaking his pencil's point. "Fuck. We *need* to get to the Warp; not being able to get to the Warp was the problem with the sphere-popping plan in the first place. This might *work*."

Doktor explained that he would rather die of starvation than fall into the Warp, but Igneous was ahead of him. "We know the whaleship will return to attempt rendezvous with us in a matter of hours. I've looked at the intrusion logs; the system recorded the precise time whenever we spelljammed in for the barest few nanoseconds. We can -- I can rig something to launch the Marble and break the sphere at the exact right moment. Then we and the whaleship will be cast into the Warp at the same place and time, and we'll be within the Geller bubble, and we can navigate to...fuck. To Sigil."

Doktor asked for the odds of success of both steps of the plan: entering the Warp within the whaleship's Geller field, and nagivating to Sigil, which would be our only visible beacon but which lay in the deepest chaos of the Warp.

Igneous filled a few pages with scribblings and diagrams before crumpling them. "You don't want to know. Let's try everything else first."

We searched again for anything looking like a map. Nothing.

Igneous used necromancy to reanimate the most intact corpse, Jen's, and began triggering muscle memories, hoping to expose another way out. Most of Jen's muscle memory had to do with hair-brushing and exfoliation. Doktor covered Aephyr's eyes for a couple of the more private muscle memories. Nothing indicated that Jen had ever left the station.

As the rendezvous loomed, the party resigned themselves to the reality that the insane sphere-popping plan would actually be put into action. M'k's eyes literally sparkled. Some of the sparkles caught things on fire.

We prepared for our exit. Igneous collected more data and samples, then carefully prepared a device that would push the Marble when triggered by the station's sensors. He explained at length how he was ripping out sources of unnecessary latency. M'k went around collecting documents and memorizing every scrap of writing in the station, from the annotated sketches of daemon-hide to the label on Jen's pants; perhaps Octocat could translate them later.

Aephyr used his phase sword to carve away the walls on either side of the station, until he reached the crystal sphere itself. Doktor carried the heavier loot to the shuttle, which was still in the middle of the level where we'd left it. He stared wistfully at the undersized power armor.

It was go time. M'k stilled his Rod where Igneous told him to, and Igneous put the Marble assembly in place and pre-activated it. "Go get 'em."

We piled into the shuttle and waited for all hell to break loose.

## Scene 3: All Hail

M'k could feel as the whale flickered in and out of the sphere.

He could feel as the sphere began to strain against the Rod and Marble.

He could feel the Rod holding fast, and the Marble steadfastly in motion.

He could feel the sphere shatter, all at once, as though he himself were shattering, as though each particle of his being were shattering into an infinitude of worlds. And they were, he realized. They always had been. This had been what Vectron had been telling him all along.

And then they were in the Warp, with no whale in sight. No Geller field.

They were all already dead, by the plainest of logic. M'k had exactly zero seconds in which to do something. This was more than enough time, given what he was feeling and seeing and learning and understanding, and given where he was doing it. M'k spent a good long portion of those zero seconds staring at the warp through the godshatter of jagged crystal, eyes unaverted and unblinking, drawing into himself by degrees and then by torrents the raw power of belief that had for so long held a pocket of reality safe from the Warp.

The fragments, which had been drifting into the chaos, drifted back, surrounding M'k, shielding the party. Embracing them, tenderly. At the end of those zero seconds, they were still intact.

Then a whale swallowed them.

## Scene 4: Fire Sail

We were parked in the whaleship's mouth, the shattered sphere engulfing the shuttle and intersecting whale-flesh harmlessly. It hadn't been large enough to preserve the whole station, though the whale could have. The portal was lost to the Warp, which was probably for the best. Our captain was immediately horrified to see that the Marble, at which he'd been staring with worry, had been lost as well.

For his part, M'k was disappointed to be without his Rod, his trusty, and only, weapon, garment, and Implement. He could, he realized, have held onto it during the whole procedure; the shuttle could have been placed at the edge of the sphere. Would things have been better, or worse, had the Rod not been sacrificed along with the Marble to buy their safety? Would a sacrifice of Motion had been somehow wrong without a partner of Stillness? Had Vectron seen to it that they would act as they did? More so than usual, obviously?

Igneous checked his bag of holding immediately, making several sounds in quick succession as he realized he was missing more things (the box of snakes, some biofoam) but that most of our loot was intact.

The redshirts, surprised and relieved at our return and terrified at having jumped into the Warp unexpectedly, were reluctant to cross M'k's boundary, but they had urgent messages for the captain. Messages along the lines of, "Holy shit, how did we get into the warp? Where are we going? Are those fragments of a crystal sphere? Where is Scarlett, and whose corpse is that?"

Doktor came to his senses, realizing that we needed to set a course immediately. He started to shake M'k, who was still laughing maniacally. Ah, I forgot to mention that. He was laughing so hard it looked painful, not seeming to draw in breath for minutes at time -- perhaps not at all? He flailed and writhed, rolling on the floor and then, when he found he could, on the ceiling.

When he couldn't get M'k to stop laughing, Doktor covered up M'k's mouth, hoping to apply his Karen strategy. M'k simply kept laughing, with no air, liver-spotted chest heaving.

After a few minutes of this, Doktor gave up on the laughter and just started giving orders. M'k kept laughing, kept writhing, but he willed an "Aye aye" into his Captain's mind.

Another mental message: "We've never gone nearly so deep into the Warp. It won't be easy. There's been something I've been meaning to try, but it's going to take some Luck."

M'k sat cross-legged on the ceiling, laughing only very slightly less, and began to cast the same spell over and over. The air thickened, vision warping, as the sphere of shattered crystal grew clearer and brighter. The magical emanations strengthed with each cast.

A minute later, M'k willed a message to the assembled crew:

"I've chosen a path. Let's go to Sigil."

*****

An uneventful day of travel passed. M'k was asked a great number of questions, which he answered clearly and simply. Nobody understood the answers.

A funeral was held for Scarlett.

____

Another day of smooth sailing saw the last of the loot dispensed among the party. Igneous hoped to reverse-engineer Karen's invulnerability and take it for himself, while Tau, perhaps, would wear the armor we planned to make from Karen's skin. Doktor worked with Igneous on ideas for modifying human power armor to fit a particularly large ork. Zephyr might take the magical boots, and might use the magical knife, unless it seemed like M'k would make good use of it. M'k had bonded with Amira's power sword, for the time being.

The jar of "sand" (which weighed some 40 kg, by the way) turned out to be full of nanites, which wanted to reassemble themselves; we allowed this under controlled conditions. They became...a wolf. Igneous found and deciphered their radio command interface, and found they could be ordered to store themselves inside a host. He nearly killed himself figuring that out; goblins are too small to fit wolves inside of, as M'k had repeatedly told him in somewhat less relevant earlier scenarios. Captain Meetslab, apparently resigned to being a nesting ground for bizarre things, filled his belly with the powdered wolf, gaining a bit of a paunch. It looked good with the mustache, though. Sir.

M'k decided to carve the a wand out of the magically boring stick. This took some time, as magic items are extremely durable; it was a matter of extremely small shavings removed via power sword. This was way too boring and he put it off until the next day.

*****

There wasn't much to do on the third day. M'k got ready to work on his wand, then decided that it could probably wait until tomorrow. Transcribing page after page of unreadable text for Octocat to translate was somehow much less boring.

M'k finally stopped laughing. Everyone slept better.

*****

Everything was suddenly on fire.

The air was on fire. The floor was on fire.

The fire extinguishers seemed to be *particularly* on fire.

M'k teleported to the shower. The water was on fire.

The party, screaming in pain, cut into the whale's flesh, trying to douse themselves in whale blood, which was on fire.

M'k teleported to the airlock, and vented it. Aha! Even if everything is on fire, *nothing* can't be on fire! M'ks own air, provided by what he'd taken to calling his territory, took a second after creation before it was on fire. M'k let the room continue to vent, cast a portal, and teleported back to get the others.

Arriving, he cast another portal below himself, falling back into the safety of the airlock as he urged the others to join him.

Igneous, however, had already concocted a better plan; after all, surviving the fire wasn't worth much if the ship were destroyed, or if we lost too many crew to make it to Sigil. Igneous, his hands shaking with pain, readied a vial he'd been saving for quite some time. He pressed it against Doktor Meetslab's face and opened it, allowing the unusually powerful ice elemental within to bond with the captain's hidden laser-eye.

Doktor faced the wall and fired. The laser went nowhere near where he meant to aim -- the captain has terrible aim -- but he literally couldn't miss the whale surrounding us. The entire ship grew ice-cold instantly, the fire consumed by hoarfrost. Thank Vectron that we were in a living ship, such that an elemental would treat it all as a unified whole.

We looked on with dismay as the ice began to melt; small patches of cursed fire began to reappear. But Doktor's magnificent mustache ruffled itself gloriously, like an infinite sun-dappled field of tall grass rippling in the wind, or like Vectron's mustache rippling in the wind, and the captain stood straighter, and crossed his arms, and glared at the fires so hard that they subsided.

Like I always say: fuck Warp travel. Fuck it left, right, and sideways.

Like I also always say: nice fucking mustache, Captain.

We checked on the crew. The humans were wounded, terrified, and confused, but alive. The reptiles had already gone back to work on some song about a dragon. Igneous decided to give them some help, as they were having some problems with rhyme and meter.

Sigil loomed.

# Interlude: Genetics Research
### From the notes of Igneous

For the first week of the trip, Igneous was very responsible.  He made the modifications to the power armor.  And while the welds were cooling, he advised his comrades on leather-working, and went down to the shooting gallery and learned to use projectile weaponry. He even figured out how to adapt Artery Cauterizing Shot to work with hydrostatic shock (you don't want to know).  And this wasn't just because he was waiting for Octocat's translations.

But one week was enough, and he then descended upon the human genetics lab like a one man swarm of locusts.

The humans really had made an incredible breakthrough. The usual problem with splicing a complex phenotypes into adults is that the fetal morphogen cascade don't happen.   But they do occur in potentia via teleological imperative in a transfiguration such as lycanthropy.  There's no sign that Luna's design notes have been obtained (or existed in the first place) but the Humans found the first 10^11 eigenvectors...

*****

At about this point, Igneous's notes become illegible.  And his cries from the lab include phrases like "differentiable along any definition of life" and "those short sighted fools: I'll show them!".  By the time the whale arrived in Sigil, only blood curdling yowls could be heard from the inside, and a sign on the door read:

> DO NOT ENTER FOR ANY REASON.    
> (if we have arrived in sigil, please procure for me one (1) bat, any species, preferably alive)


# Belated Prologue: The Story of Samuel

Samuel is the third child of Rick and Evelyn Carnahan, and grew up in the dirt.

Not in the socioeconomic sense – his parents both did quite well for themselves in their endeavors – but as a child of “high-risk archeologists” (Tomb Raiders in less polite company) he found himself spending quite a lot of time in or under the ground. Though ever since his eldest brother got a little too involved in the ‘high-risk’ aspect as a child, his parents have been more cautious in raising the
rest of their children so Samuel spent quite a lot of his impressionable years with his uncle – a fast-talking thief with a high opinion of himself (it says a lot about the family’s usual antics that he was considered the better option).

Growing up, he was homeschooled by his mother, and entertained on his uncle’s stories. Much of his childhood was spent dragged across the Wheel from one dungeon to the next, across a dozen crystal spheres. His parents chasing rumors of unexplored ruins while he spent much of his time at the dig camps, being endlessly entertained by his uncle and ‘uncles and aunties’ (various friends and
acquaintances his parents have made over the years) and spending time in whatever passed for the nearest town at the feet of the local storytellers.

Growing up next to the ruins of civilizations long past - where knowledge of them lies on the border of history and myth - lends a perspective and urgency to Sigmar’s teachings hard to come by in more settled areas. Civilization seems robust, inevitable - but when one looks at history on the scale of millennia, many die as mere infants, killed almost as soon as they are born. Perhaps it is a coincidence most long-lived civilizations appear in those races with long lives, perhaps it is just that humans are particularly bad at it, perhaps its a feature rather than a bug and we haven’t quite figured out what it’s good for. That last one was probably reaching a bit far, and in such an actively hostile universe, rather than a merely uncaring one, death of civilization could mean near extinction for humans - reduced to fragment communities in enclaves like an endangered animal in zoos.

Growing up human meant growing up Sigmarism in his family - somewhat ironic considering the family occupation, but provided a stark perspective that few ever consider. There was some combination of emotions to be felt if one took a proper look back at human history - awe, humility, pride, fear, and underlying it all, a helpless rage. History was so large it made one feel small, the cycles of kingdoms and empires rising and falling and rising and falling. One would think after all this time we would have figured out how to keep one around by now, especially considering the possible consequences; the fall of the Roman Empire affected Europe but the vast majority of the population at the time existed in societies on different continents. Now, a small number of Crystal Spheres housed the vast majority of humans, and the universe has actively hostile powers against living, thinking beings. But why must it stay this way? Man is born knowing little but his most base instincts; it is only the teaching of the end product of millennia of knowledge, value changes, and ethics that raise him to be the preeminent conquerer of his world - the sum of generations of ancestors thinking ‘We can do better’ and passing it down so the next generation can be better, stronger, wiser. Its just that every so often something comes along and ruins it for everybody, and then they’re set back for some time while they build back up again. 

Samuel’s philosophy was never an ‘eureka’ moment; it was the collection of musings and idle thoughts - an odd combination of connecting themes between stories whilst overlooking the silent graves of dead societies. It came from sparks of thought-stuff - an idle idea one afternoon that grew and grew the more he ruminated over it. It was terrifying. It was exhilarating. All Samuel could think of was that he needed to wanted to see this through - he had a philosophy and a goal, and was looking at using the former to achieve the latter, and the itch to start slowly grew all-consuming. He wrote a note, raided the family vault for some useful things and a little spending money, and promised to write home occasionally to prevent the inevitable ‘rescue’ attempts. Samuel was now out in the Great
Wheel, and looking to shake some foundations.

Started believing in Sigmar, mostly from family inertia. Sees all the ruins of old civilizations, starts becomes disenchanted with Sigmar. Taught large amounts of history by parents occupation, sees the constant pattern of different societies rising, then most of them falling - either from internal conflict or being conquered by other societies. Starts thinking that Sigmar doesn’t care about any specific civilization, if one falls - he eventually beings being worshiped by the one that comes after. Most people don’t think about this because everybody assumes their society will continue to exist forever. More disenchanted by Sigmar - to be fair most of the disenchantment stems from the assumption that Sigmar cares about this civilization continuing and will take steps to protect it when instead it
looks that Sigmar only cares about a civilization spreading but is ambivalent about any specific one. Furthermore, he sees the constant conquering and destruction of civilizations as wasteful - if one is conquered by another they remove any value that society might have created, if one falls from within then there is no guarantee another will come along again.

Samuel still believes in the values that Sigmar holds, but wants his society to keep existing, and thinks that there must be a better way than this. Human beings no longer live such short, brutish lives as their ancestors, why has the lifecycle of civilizations not changed since the Iron Age?

# Session Ten: Unstable
### From the logs of M'K'Splswap

## Scene 1: Bard from Entry

We finally arrived at Sigil. The center of the wheel. The mighty donut.

The whale skidded to a stop on the shipyard's tarmac. It didn't seem happy; whales don't have landing gear. Doktor, a Sigil native, led M'k and Aephyr into the biggest city they'd ever seen.

We were immediately approached by a very average-looking human looking for work. He explained that he was a bad cook, out of shape, and a poor fighter, but that he was a skilled storyteller and entertainer. We explained that we routinely put ourselves in deadly combat situations and that, should he join our crew, he would almost certainly die horribly. He didn't care; he said he wanted to make the Wheel a better place. What a go-getter! We hired him. His name is Samuel.

Samuel also explained his personal goal of harvesting belief until he could become a god. We wished him luck, although Doktor reminded the human, who was also new to Sigil, that the Lady of Pain probably wouldn't appreciate such talk.

We went to do some shopping. We had just purchased some drive and detox when a strange beast, huge and long-trunked and led by an elf, snorted up Aephyr's shadow. We later learned that the thing was called an "umbravore", and that the shadow constituted or represented an Umbra-bound part of our halfling's soul. Losing it is not good for you.

Despite not fully understanding this at the time, we did recognize that this asshole had stolen something from us.

When we challenged the elf, he leapt on the umbravore and bolted. Octocat used her magic to command the umbravore to stop, but the elf was still uncooperative.

M'k teleported in front of the thing and cut the elf's leg nearly off with his power sword. By this point the umbravore was cuddling with Octocat. M'k cast a portal on a nearby window, to be able to give the elf a painful but non-lethal fall if he decided to make a break for it on foot.

That didn't turn out to be necessary. As Doktor kindly applied some biofoam to stabilize the bloody leg wound, Samuel proved his worth by coaxing the elf into dialogue.

Meanwhile, M'k spotted someone stealing some kind of big, shiny orb from something with big wings covered with smaller wings covered with even tinier wings (and so on). Clearly a Celestial. M'k decided to retrieve the orb. The owner might be Vectron-aligned!

The thief had already run around the street corner and escaped from sight, but M'k caught up in time to see the him slink into the crowd, while a decoy, who looked exactly the same, was being apprehended.

M'k cast another portal beneath the thief's feet, to give him that painful but non-lethal fall.

Returning to the group, M'k realized that he'd failed to notice that his initial portal had been cast directly above a stall selling "Artisanal Stabby-Sticks". The thief's blood was tracing artful but non-non-lethal patterns over the intricately-carved sticks. M'k silently prayed to Vectron for the poor thief's soul.

The Celestial, whom I'll refer to as Wings, searched the corpse, but couldn't find the orb. M'k returned to the decoy, explaining that his partner was dead and that he should probably return the stolen goods. The decoy hit M'k with a mango, punched his armor to even less effect than you'd expect, and then slipped and fell on his ass. M'k realized the decoy was performing slapstick to make a scene intentionally. The decoy also didn't have the orb.

M'k cast another portal under the decoy, dispelling the one above the stabby-store and leaving the decoy falling back and forth through the two portals on the floor. This is the same way M'k sleeps; now that's an air mattress. M'k returned to the rest of the party and cast a portal on a wall at street level, safely dumping the decoy, who didn't try to escape.

Samuel drew from the thief the barest mention of some sort of cult. At this, the thief's face melted half off.

The thief having clammed up, Samuel turned his attention to Wings, who explained that the stolen orb was a trapped fellow Celestial by the name of Mirror Eyes, the freedom of whom they had been trying to purchase. Wings requested our help retrieving Mirror Eyes, who served as a gatekeeper against hostile incursion from the Umbra. This seemed both important and fun, so we agreed.

Before we could decide what to do with our two captives (melty-face and the decoy), we spotted a tiny pixie sniper on a nearby rooftop, rifle trained on us but not firing. M'k teleported up to question him, but the pixie took off towards the "roof" of Sigil, where they could lose themself in the crowd. Hollow donut, remember?

M'k could ignore gravity, of course, but Doktor had warned him not to reveal his status as a demiurge. M'k asked for permission to pursue, which was denied. M'k instead magically hailed the pixie, commanding him to stop in the name of Vectron; the pixie replied with a traditional Vectronian blessing. Huh. They couldn't be that bad.

Samuel decided to help out by throwing a grenade at the pixie, who was some forty meters away from him in midair and would therefore only be reached by an incredibly precise throw. Samuel managed to throw the grenade about three meters, nearly killing himself and Aephyr and lightly scratching Doktor's armor. Bards...

Doktor attempted to pin the pixie with suppressing fire, to...limited effect.

Wings was convinced to fly up and capture the pixie, who after all might be involved with Mirror Eyes' captors. Our Celestial friend remanded the pixie to Meetslab's fist.

The pixie, who declined to share their name but whom I'll call Pixie, turned out to be innocent of both crimes -- obviously, given that they followed Vectron. Pixie had been watching the shadow thief, along with their partners in crime, who had also been leading umbravores around and stealing shadows, though we hadn't seen them from within the crowd. Pixie had spotted the band of thieves retreating to the undercity, which we learned was a place under the city.

We decided to take our captives somewhere more private, and rented a room at the nearest tavern.

## Scene 2: Spirited Conversation

Leaving the umbravore in the tavern's stables, we were led to our reasonably nice and unreasonably expensive lodgings, and we continued to interrogate the shadow-stealing elf. Unfortunately, his mouth was firmly shut, apart from the gaping hole that continued to weep foul, black pus. He made it clear that he was willing to die before he said another word. Doktor surmised that the man might be a follower of Acerath, which would explain the melting face and his willingness to die before revealing any more secrets, and which was tentatively confirmed by the elf refusing to reveal his alignment when pressed.

We turned our attentions to the decoy orb-thief. Inspecting him for the first time, we noticed that he was wearing around his neck a mirror draped in feathers. The mirror showed the reflection of a vague form that was not actually present in the room, or at least, not in the Materium.

Wings chimed in that he recognized the device: it held in place a spirit, which was controlling the decoy. We decided to release the spirit, but first we wanted to get Aephyr drunk, so that he might have a better shot at capturing it. Aephyr was always better at stealing metaphysical objects when he was a little tipsy. Or so we assumed, anyway. It stands to reason.

We sent Aephyr down to the bar to pick up a half-pint bottle of brandy; he returned with three, one of which he had already finished. M'k nabbed the second, and took a swig; Aephy stole it back and took a swig; M'k took it back and cast Call Item on it; Aephyr snatched it back and took a swig; M'k Called it and took a swig, and so on. They'd finished the bottle before Doktor could confiscate the third, which Aephyr was already moving to open.
Realizing that Aephyr might actually die, we convinced him to induce vomiting. Great. The room was carpeted, by the way.

It worked out, though. We removed the mirror, and Aephyr managed to capture the smokey cloud of escaping spirit in one of the empty bottles.

The decoy, unensorcelled, identified himself as Johnos. We gave him detox for the polymorphine he'd taken to look like the thief; back in his own skin, he seemed to relax. He told us that he'd been captured after being lured to a cult orgy, where he'd been strapped to an altar and drenched in liquid shadow until some of it had taken root in him. They'd chanted something about their "mighty will" "pushing through the veil". Johnos gave us directions to the cult's temple in the undercity.

Johnos continued, explaining that the orb-thief had also been under the control of a spirit; M'k felt pretty bad about the whole "accidentally killing him" thing, and prayed for the forgiveness of mighty Vectron. Furthermore, the orb had been hidden in a barrel of produce owned by a shopkeep who had also been possessed against his will.

M'k immediately teleported back, but the barrel was gone, along with the rest of the stall.

Back in the tavern, the party planned a raid on the cult; Johnos, still peeved, agreed to help.

## Scene 3: Of One's Former Self

A robed figure strode with poise and confidence through the gloom of the undercity, stopping before the outstretched palm of the drab building's lone guard, who issued a challenge.

"Where the veils go thin?"

"Stories make freedom."

"Was your quest successful?"

"It was."

As the guard moved aside, something smaller emerged from the cloak, crept towards the guard, made two quick motions, and then returned, unseen.

Five adepts of the order greeted the robed figure within. Three humans, a gnome, and one with too many eyes. The something smaller passed by each of them, unseen, before returning to its concealment. A caged bird of prey the size of a Dobermann ignored the cultists, instead watching with hunger the five tethered umbravores.

"Open the way!"

One of the cultists untied the umbravores and shooed them into the pen, which surrounded an eldritch-looking pylon covered in runes and messy wiring. He activated the pylon, and lightning arced out to strike the animals, which shook, and bellowed, and then vomited shadows, which pooled on the floor.

The cultists began to chant about that which would come through. The bird's iron perch slowly melted beneath its talons.

Aephyr's tranq hit the cultists all at once. Two doses each were enough to level them instantly; a thud outside the door marked the guard succumbing. Samuel dropped his robe, revealing the halfling, Octocat, and M'k's floating Eye.

In a nearby alley, M'k and Doktor were steadily demolishing deep-fried salamander dogs from the kind of street cart you normally don't approach unless stumbling drunk. M'k idly inscribed Exploding Runes on the stack of receipts he'd bought from the vendor. A portal to nowhere waited on a brick wall next to them.

Seeing the cultists fall, M'k got Doktor's attention, handed him the receipts, and teleported. The portal opened to reveal the cultists' headquarters, and Doktor stepped through.

Octocat was in the midst of befriending the giant jet-black raptor. Aephyr was trying to scoop up the shadows from the floor, and failing.

M'k, realizing that the shadow Aephyr needed was still in the tavern stables, teleported back. He led the umbravore through a portal and into the pen, where it was zapped by the pylon, then shook, bellowed, and vomited.

Aephyr failed to capture the shadow that emerged. The party was now concerned: the shadows had begun to thin and fade. By Vectron's boots, we would not lose this shard of Aephyr's soul.

M'k again teleported to the tavern to find Wings, who was nursing a Jynnan Tonyx at the bar. M'k frantically ushered the Celestial through a portal to Aephyr's aid, but it was already too late: the shadow dissipated before their eyes. Aephyr sat staring at the floor.
The door slammed open, and in strode a familiar face, the same one that the orb-thief and his decoy had worn. He was holding the orb that was Mirror Eyes. That he had chosen to disguise his catspaws as himself begged for explanation, but it would have to wait: Doktor seemed relieved at the simplicity of his task as he tackled the interloper, roaring at the top of his lungs. Our captain collected the orb and swiftly backed away, the weight of a ten-foot orc in power armor having led the cultist to relieve himself.

Doktor stared at the orb, poking and twisting at it ineffectually, before handing it to Wings, who twisted it just as Doktor had.

The orb blossomed, expanding into peaks and folds and jagged ridges, the exact shape of its perfectly mirrored surface impossible to discern.

We asked Mirror Eyes what would become of Aephyr without his shadow, and were told that he hadn't lost much of his soul, that he would probably be mostly OK, and that what was lost could perhaps regrow, mostly, with time.

We had to kill the umbravores, which would have stolen more shadows if released. M'k activated his power sword, strode into the pen, was hit by the pylon's lightning, and started vomiting. Aephyr unplugged the pylon and reminded M'k that he was risking his shadow; M'k blinked away to let Aephyr do the job, relieving some of his frustration by cutting the beasts down one by one. We ignored Octocat's forlorn pleas to spare her "friends".

Mirror Eyes told us that the cultist who'd brought the orb was not the mastermind, but another spirit-snatched thrall of a multitude demon, wearing its preferred form. When we threatened to find and free the daemon's other bodies, it started answering our questions. The cult was bringing in spirits to spread the daemon. The bird was from a place called Menagerie, was nearly immortal, and caused "unimportant" things around it to fade to nothingness. On the cultist with too many eyes, we had found a chain of manacles, shackled to each other: it was the key to a portal leading to a primitive prime world; the portal, which could be traversed in either direction, was an archway by a certain fountain in Sigil. We took the thrall's mirror pendant, releasing the shopkeeper, who accepted a dose of detox to regain his own appearance. Aephyr captured the spirit.

Octocat cheered up when we agreed to keep the bird as a pet, although it would need to be kept away from the redshirts -- the ones without names, at the very least.

While we searched the other cultists, freeing those who were thralls and finding tranq and polymorphine, Samuel talked to the Celestials, explaining his worldview and goals. Mirror Eyes invited us to his office in the highest heaven of Celestia, and offered to take Samuel there, though that would require Samuel's death; he declined the offer. Mirror Eyes showed us the rune that would identify him, should we make our way by other means. Pretty chill guy, for a huge shiny blob.

M'k portalled the party back to the whale, where we prepared for what would surely be the most dangerous part of the day: dinner.

## Scene 4: Sleepy Pete's Fried Frogs and Friendly Fire

When Sleepy Pete opened his eponymous restaurant, he christened it with a simple two-word possessive noun phrase. But one fateful evening, during an otherwise unremarkable bar fight, a pair of errant krak missiles struck and mortally wounded an uninvolved patron. The customer was a powerful warlock; with his dying breaths, he first left a glowing review of the soup of the day, then placed a memetic curse on the establishment's neon sign, appending words that were never the same twice. The same effect bound any who spoke or wrote the name, forever warning travellers of this most dangerous corner of Sigil.

Captain Doktor Meetslab wasn't eager to bring the rest of us to his old workplace. He explained to the party that patronizing Sleepy Pete's Fish Head Soup and Tire Irons was horrifically dangerous at best, and that it might be significantly worse to visit in the company of an employee who was now late for work by nearly a year. But he had told too many tales of the restaurant's unique culinary thrills, and the party insisted on making the pilgrimage. Dewey wanted to come, too.

We donned or cast our heaviest armor, our weapons at the ready. M'k sent his Eye to the restaurant, sparing us the trek through Sigil's most dangerous neighborhood, less ghetto than warzone. When it arrived, allowing M'k to portal the party in, the Eye was dripping flaming napalm and was being chewed on by some sort of imp. Karen's otherworldly resilience worked in our favor, for once. Doktor shooed the monster away, absently, as we made our way past the bouncer, who was bleeding to death and half-melted by some sort of acid. Doktor remarked on the tiny bipedal warbots that had replaced the mutant fire-breathing guard pigs, and which were defending the bouncer's aspiring corpse from thieves, as we crossed the threshold into the cacophonous, fragrant bustle.

"MEEEEEETSLAAAAAAB! YOU ARE LATE FOR WORK!"

We braced for combat with the proprietor. He was a massive ork, nearly Doktor's size, wearing ancient and warworn power armor, bald, with shaggy eyebrows to match his mighty salt-and-pepper beard, his face scarred and deeply wrinkled. But Pete was in fine humor, merely ordering our captain to clean the toilets. The rest of us were led to a booth in the back, near the kitchen, secluded enough that only one knife fight was visible from our vantage point.

We ordered. Octocat: Reuben. M'k: pulled pork. Aephyr, still tipsy: "what they had". Sam: barbecued wampa. Dewey: mystery ribs.

Doktor emerged from the bathrooms just as the food arrived (including Aephyr's meta-sandwich, a Reuben and a pulled pork stacked between even more bread), and Sleepy Pete beckoned for him to join us at our booth. Our captain spoke with care as he explained that he might not be able to continue his employment at Sleepy Pete's Bludgeoned Horse and Rat Traps.

Sleep Pete narrowed his eyes, and Meetslab began to tell the story from the beginning. "When I stepped into the bathroom..."

*****

Sometime around when, in the story, the party was fighting an invincible naked man next to a portal to hell, Sleepy Pete interrupted, turning to the rest of us.

"How are the sandwiches?"

"Fucking awesome."

*****

"That was when M'k here ascended into being some sort of demigod."

M'k smiled and waved. Sleepy Pete raised his eyebrows and nodded approval.

*****

"...and so, you see, I have a crew now. I have obligations."

"I understand, Doktor, unusual as this is for me. You are not beholden. Do you remember Steve?"

"Of course. We had a pool going, on how he would die. Did he...?"

"Yes. He was attempting the Unstable Sandwich."

"...that fool."

"Yes. So," Sleepy Pete addressed the group, "Is there anything with which I can help you?"

We asked a number of questions. No, Sleepy Pete didn't know anything about Helvetica, creator of the Marble. Nor of Orobas. The most powerful tattoo artist in Sigil was Fell, a Dabu. The most powerful bard was at the forefront of the infinite rave -- the party that swept endlessly around Sigil, enrapturing all in its wake.

Doktor described the necrodermis heart and soulstone dagger we had found, and the transorkist goal he hoped to accomplish with them. He asked if Sleepy Pete knew of a soul mage who could provide assistance.

"The creator of Baron Vash."

The ruler of the Vash Barony was very, very old. He was as old as Sigil's 13 factions, and had been a main player in the war that had sundered them. Sleepy Pete went to his office and returned with a bounty poster, which showed a squat, cylindrical machine, no larger than our stack of plates (licked clean). The Barony stretched across a cluster of spheres.

"Be warned that Vash is far more powerful than he appears. You wouldn't guess it, but he fits an MP lascannon in there, and a nullray. And his territory...anyone can enter, but none can leave."

"Now, Meetslab. You haven't eaten. For my most resilient and accomplished employee, I would like to make something special. Would you like to attempt...the Unstable Sandwich?"

Doktor went silent and still.

"Yes."

Sleepy Pete solemnly took his leave. We waited in hushed anticipation -- apart from Aephyr, who left to piss -- as from the kitchen came the sound of beating hammers, the rev of chainsaws, the bleating of slaughtered animals, the hiss of arc welding, the murmured chorus of chanted incantations, the indescribable yet regrettably familiar howl of warp phenomena, and, finally, the ding of an oven timer.

The sandwich that Sleepy Pete brought out on a meter-wide platter was larger than Aephyr. It was piled high with too many ingredients to list in full, among them dragon meat, unicorn meat, irradiated normal beast, and spices I could be killed for naming, including the one that turns your eyes blue. The bread looked to be a fine Lamuellan ciabatta.

It took Doktor an hour to finish the abomination, and it was no sure thing. He wept fluids that did not seem wholly biological in nature, and the sweat that dripped from his brow burned pits in his armor. Thin grey smoke escaped from every orifice and assumed portentous shapes before dissipating with tiny screams.

When he had taken the final bite, he licked his plate clean, and he leaned back in his seat, his face a picture of blissful exhaustion. We stared in awe, Sleepy Pete glowing with approval, as Doktor took several minutes to compose himself.

"That was...it was..."

Sleepy Pete waved away Doktor's attempt at thanks. Our captain straightened, suddenly alert.

"Sleepy Pete. Boss. I should warn you. The portal that took me from here was in the third stall in the men's room. It leads to Yehket, which is crawling with zombies. I do not know its key."

"Also, where is Aephyr?"
.

# Session Eleven: Lost and Found

## Jumbled
### From the logs of M'k'Splswap

We realized that we had lost Aephyr to the portal to Yehket, surely to be consumed by zombies. Six of us had gone to dinner at Sleepy Pete's Snail Eyes and Nail Pies, and five had returned: truly an impressive survival rate.

Returning to the whale, we were surprised and relieved to see Igneous out of his lab, and then immediately horrified to recognize that he had somehow managed to become even uglier. His head was wider, and the space in his newly-stretched grin was filled with extra fangs. His long ears were even longer, and where they'd extended horizontally, they now bent at a right angle skyward.

"I appreciate your purchase of that bat. Alta brought it to me."

We stared.

"Everything is fine."

Thus completely reassured, we settled in for the night.

******

### From the logs of Igneous

## The Rave

While Igneous was busy figuring out Human genetic enhancement technology, and testing it out by granting himself a bat's power of echolocation, the party acquired a bard, named Samuel.

Bards are something of a mystery: many prime worlds independently claim they have access to all sorts of special magical powers, but empirically they don't – just ordinary enchantment and illusion spells.  Samuel thought he had the answer: the art of world-bending music tended to get lost somewhere along the path to civilization, but with the right teacher he could learn it.  The right teacher was the lead guitarist of the Eternal Rave.

After a long an wandering discussion (apparently a cabal of dragons suppresses the helicopter rental industry in Sigil), we devised a plan.  We spot-welded Samuel into a steel harness, and attached him to both a lamppost on the ground and the roof of a nearby building.  The cables we attached him with allowed him about ten meters of movement, but hopefully would prevent him from following the Rave when it passed by.  

Would he be able to learn enough as the Rave passed?  Learning is hard to predict, but he hoped the Rave would linger by him if he impressed them enough with his musical skill.

Well, he impressed them all right.  He impressed them so much that they cut the steel cables holding him in place.  It seems with the right musical knowledge, an axe guitar functions as a battleaxe, and slices through tempered steel like warm butter.  How is this possible?  It can't be a straightforward sonic effect.  Perhaps the dionysian psionics of the rave focus raw Chaos energy, and the cable reverted to a higher entropy state when struck?  Subsequent examination of the cables did not show oxidation, but that might just be a sign of geometric precision.

In any case, we reverted to plan B.  Igneous, stationed a safe distance away, attempted to tranquilize Samuel with his needle gun.  Sigil's concave nature makes long sightlines easy, but the shot was still too difficult.  The dart missed, and struck the Rave's singer.

The Rave treated this as an attack, and fell upon our party in a sphere of subjective gravity – similar, but not magically identical to, a demi-urge's AT field.  The leader of the attack, a topologically confusing vampire, proved to be devastatingly violent, so the party portalled out.  Fortunately, the Rave was too busy partying to hold a grudge, and forgot about us as soon as we were no threat.

## A Cleaner Rescue

After we took a bit of time to patch our wounds, we devised a Plan C for rescuing Samuel, who was now playing bass guitar with the Rave while riding on the shoulders of a pair of Tieflings.

As preparation, we rented a room in Sigil and M'k placed a portal on the ceiling.  We offered to help him resist the Rave by either drugging or deafening him, but he ultimately declined both.

M'k teleported to high above the Rave, opened a portal under the Tieflings, let the fall through, and closed it.

Igneous webbed the arriving ravers.

M'k teleported back before hitting the ground.  His teleport did not match velocities with the destination, but his skill at acrobatics, combined with landing on a pair of webbed tieflings, prevented serious injury.  And his ability to gather quintessence, was quickly healed.

Igneous and Doktor rendered the ravers unconscious, with a mixture of tranquilizers and blood chokes.  We then dumped the tieflings on the street and didn't ask what became of them.

When Samuel awoke, he was happy to be free, and reported success: he knew the legendary Highway to Hell Guitar Kata.

## Oh My God It's Full Of Stars

Our next mission was to investigate Igneous's bag of holding, which had been losing items.  Igneous, Octocat and Samuel took it to the lab, while Doktor commanded some crew and M'k went to play parcheesi with some Vectronians or something.

Leaving some bait and a camera in the bag resulted in sabotage to the camera, plus the disappearance of the bait.  This suggested a sentient adversary.

Magical examination of the bag revealed a nearly linear structure of foreign magic on the interior surface.  Visual examination revealed this to be a zipper.

It was now clear that the items were disappearing because someone was taking them, and this is how that someone was getting in and out.  This made the idea of going into the bag far more appealing.

The zipper had no pull tab on the bag side, but the slide was ferrous metal and easily pulled with a neodymium magnet.  Beyond was a microgravity space traversed by ropes and lit by an extremely bright jar, which seemed to somehow contain a star.  The space had a breathable atmosphere of unclear origin.  A sign, not attached to anything, proclaimed “Welcome to Lost and Found”.

We sent a camera drone to explore, but it was soon stolen.  We began to suspect (correctly, it turned out) that this was the home base of the Thief of Stars.  Around this time we called Captain Meetslab, who came running.

## A War of Vomit

Determined to have his revenge on the Thief of Stars, Doktor Meetslab attempted to crawl through the zipper.  He was able to stick his head through the hole.  His shoulders, even pauldronless, had no chance of fitting through.

From this new vantage point, Doktor was able to see what was mounted on the outside of our own bag, which had been hidden from previous explorations: three crew-operated tripod-mounted fully automatic machine guns, pointed straight at his head at point blank range.

All three unloaded on him.  Between his power armor and his sheer innate toughness, he suffered a bloody lip.

Next, the Thief of Stars himself arrived.  He closed the zipper until Doktor's neck blocked it.  With his arms and weapons on the wrong side of the bag and no leverage for a head-butt, Doktor seemed helpless.  And the Thief looked him right in the eye to gloat.

The prosthetic eye.  The one which was actually a laser cannon.

Doktor has no skill with ranged weapons, but at point-blank range and with Samuel's musical assistance, he melted half of the Thief's face.

Adding insult to injury, he opened his faceplate and vomited a wolf.

The machine-gun crews turned and ran.  But the Thief was made of sterner stuff.  Taking advangage of open faceplate, he stole Doktor's mustache, and anti-stole a token under the Doktor's tongue.

Soon the Doktor vomited again, this time spewing forth a triple-masted frigate.  The boat snapped his jaw, but killed one of the fleeing gunner teams outright.

Doktor pulled back and let the smaller team members try things.  Octocat sought to befriend the gunners, but they were too terrified.  Igneous webbed the Thief and wolf together, and shot the former with a tranq dart to little effect.  The wolf, taking advantage of the Thief's limited mobility, ripped off his right arm.

The Thief then tried to steal the wolf.  Apparently he knew the encoding, so he grew two size categories (revealing his own werewolf nature) and ordered it to nest in him.

(It was probably around this time that somebody (most likely Lance Corporal Dewey Scrubbs, The Dragonslayer) radioed M'k and suggested he come back.)

Igneous concluded the bottleneck at the zipper was crippling their fighting, so he went all the way through into Lost and Found, zooming through the open space.  He brought Octocat with him, but she pivoted off a gun embankment and stayed on the bag.

The Thief then vomitted the wolf at Ingeous.  The wolf was loyal to whomever it had last nested in, but Igneous was able to give it a special override to attack the thief anyway.  This required it to reverse direction in microgravity, which it did by pushing off Igneous, sending him rapidly flying the other way.

The Thief also flung an item into our bag, which landed at Doktor's feet, to no immediate effect.  This was ominous.

Finally Doktor Meetslab finished the fight with a grenade.  The Thief had no way to dodge, so he tried to steal the detonator.  Working one handed and tranquilized, he had the grenade open and the detonator between his teeth when it went off.  The Thief's body parts went in many directions.  Doktor somehow caught the bit that his mustache was attached to, and it gladly resumed its proper place on his upper lip.  Igneous took a sample as well, of course.

And then we identified the thing between Doktor's feet as a tree token.  M'k opened a portal dropping the token in our rented room, but Doktor fell through it as well.  A moment later, the tree emerged.  Having his head driven through multiple ceilings didn't hurt our good Doktor, but a sixty foot tree growing from nothing in an instant right between his legs did.  He vomited once more, from the pain.

The remaining residents of Lost and Found put up a token resistance, but between Igneous's marksmanship and Octocat's cuddliness, they quickly came around.

## On the Nature of Lost and Found

It turns out the bags of holding are quite simple.  There is a large bag, left somewhere in the astral, far from any warp-gate.  And there is a small bag, that an adventurer carries.  The two are linked so that going inside the small bag places you inside the big bag.  The small bag is nearly indestructible, but the big bag is not.  And damage to it may detach the two.

Bags that were made together may have their big bags quite close to each other, and they can be repositioned or bound with ropes without effecting their function as bags of holding.   And so Lost and Found was built.

Ordinarily, any attempt to get to the outside of a big bag will either fail or break the bag, but the Thief found a way to place zippers.  Sadly, he didn't tell anyone or write it down anywhere, so unless Igneous can reverse engineer the zippers we have, the technique is lost.  Still, this gives us twenty someodd bags, most likely on different spheres, which can be entered reliably without needing warp travel.

One bag had Orobus shoved through him, but that bag was destroyed.  Another leads to Gehenna, where Orobus's phylactery is now buried.  The rest will require exploration.

## Clues from Sleepy Pete

Once these matters were resolved, we paid another visit to Sleepy Pete.  He told us that in order to perfect the ultimate sandwich, he thinks he needs three things:

* His chef's hat, which was last seen on a sphere of communist vampires with a broken warp gate.  He has a map to said sphere from the Abyss.  The Abyss, we think, is not a crystal sphere, but a hole in the astral where the warp bleeds through, mostly clogged by the Tau sphere.  The astral surrounding it is likely full of demons which slipped around the Tau sphere and then found themselves with limited mobility in the vast astral.  Not a good place for an unarmed, unshielded whale-ship.

* A fire flower, which is offered as a prize in the Strongest Under Heaven tournament.

* The gunpowder of the Demigod of Gunz and Gansta Rap, who has no location, but might be brought forth if we made one for him.

He is also running low on dragon meat, and would appreciate a new source of that.

He does have a book on repairing and building warp gates, which he allowed Igneous to read.  Unfortunately, only a small fraction of the book's information was encoded as ink on paper, while most of it is known to the demons that are bound to the book.  Seeing little alternative, Igneous make telepathic contact with those demons and learned from them.

But he showed no signs of psychological damage afterwards.  His deep hatred of devils is nothing new.  He's always hated authoritarians who stand in the way of science, and he's always hated beings of pure evil, so hating pure evil authoritarians just makes sense.  Also, he's been in and out of academia enough to hate Elsevier from personal experience.  So this is all perfectly logical and in no way a sign of psychological damage.

## Addendum: Research Project

I forget exactly when, but Igneous and Octocat got to a good library and investigated hawking radiation and darksteel.  It seems there's a way to influence hawking radiation by dropping a large runic array into the black hole.  To create enough darksteel for Doktor Meetslab, we'll need an array 1.5x the mass of Jupiter.  Getting the darksteel into the right shape is an unsolved problem.


## Addendum: Things M'k Did

Most importantly, M'k got a totally kick-ass back tattoo of Ragna-Grogamak exploding, and then went to a UVC meeting with Pixie. What a day!

# Session Twelve: Bag of Fucks
### From the logs of M'k'Splswap

## Scene 1: Blut und Eisen

While we ticked off the last of our shopping list, including a silver sword to help with the next werewolf we encounter, Miley went to the Tau consulate, which was, of course, glorious. There were three people there, including the secretary, in front of whom Miley dropped two briefcases full of three-and-a-half-inch floppies. Genetic and research data from the human outpost, hopefully of use in the Tau's efforts to create more of their kind.

The consulate paid us as well as they could for the trove; they didn't have any money ("We'll...probably make rent this month..."), but they gave us a few artifacts that might be useful: an amulet that could store outfits and instantly change them, a magical rope for hanging yourself (not sure about that one), and a prototype jump pack. The latter was handed over with some reluctance; it had historical significance, they said.

We had two goals at this point. The first was winning the Tenkaichi Budokai; we thought Doktor would take it easily, although M'k might also compete, depending how tough the competition looked, and whether there was a prize for second place. We had six months to wait, though; in the meantime, we wanted to explore the bags of holding in the Town of Lost and Found.

The problem was that only our smallest member, Igneous, could fit through the holes in the bags, now that Octocat had retired from adventuring and settled down as the mayor of the Town. M'k could cast portals, but not to connect different spheres, though he vowed in Vectron's magnificent name to learn the trick. Until then, we would need to bridge the gap with a portable Geller projector (we could never fit one of spelljammer scale, even disassembled).

We were unable to find a portable projector on Sigil, but everyone told us that they were a dime a dozen on Titan's Arm. Titan's Arm was a titanic arm, which legend has it belonged to one of four ancient robots, of absurd scale, who first created the crystal spheres out of astral dust, perhaps including the outer planes.

We didn't have enough time to spelljam there and back before the tournament, but Samuel heard about a Sigil Door to Titan's Arm. Ominously, he didn't want to give us any details.

"You need to trust me," he said.

We barely knew the guy, but, fuck it, right? What's the worst that could happen?

He did tell us that we'd need pieces of iron and fresh menstrual blood. The iron was easy; for the blood, we had to do some digging through public restroom trash cans, but we eventually found what we needed.

We stood in a line, facing an unremarkable alleyway with only a metal rod stretching across to complete the "portal", and Samuel told us to hold hands. Into each pair of hands he placed a bloody iron rod and an unlabelled syringe. He then tied our hands together.

"Hold these, face this way, and when you feel it, go forward."

In unison, we injected the mystery substance into our thighs.

Terror gripped us, immediate and abject. Igneous seemed too stunned to move, and M'k was rooted where he stood, shaking in fear, but the others pulled them forward madly, sprinting in panic as from mortal peril.

The drug started to wear off as we passed through the Door and found ourselves in a wide tunnel, facing oncoming traffic.

## Scene 2: The Finger

Being tied wrist-to-wrist and half-crazed with fear is not the best state in which to avoid six lanes of speeding vehicles, but we managed it. Mostly. M'k teleported out of the way, as Vectron would have wished, which freed Miley, who also reached safety. Dewey and Samuel were hit, but the drivers had slammed on the brakes pretty well, and so we just bandaged them and told them to suck it up.

Exiting the tunnel, we saw a vast metropolis built from gleaming chrome. This all fit on the distal phalanx of the Arm's middle finger.

We found the Tau embassy, which was considerably larger than their outpost on Sigil. We were rather shocked when one of the functionaries actually knew our blue teammate.

"*The* James Miley?" gushed the fanboy. "I've read your dossier!"

Utterly in his element, Miley explained that he'd been on a mission from the embassy in Centuria, where we'd mitigated the damage from Orobas, and then explained how we'd collected the genetics data, a copy of which we provided. Miley asked the embassy to properly remunerate us -- he called us "his mercenaries" -- explaining that we had suffered losses in the course of providing invaluable assistance under dire conditions. An understatement.
They gave us a little cash; nothing significant compared to our existing wealth, although it was a windfall for cash-strapped Miley. They also provided a handful of useful maps and a sky-scooter for each of us (apart from M'k, who practically jumped away from the things, and who could make his own way regardless).

Samuel made contact with some archaeologists, friends-of-friends of his parents, and learned about nearby expeditions into the Arm; Igneous expressed interest in the months-long delves, but that would have to wait.

We were, as promised, easily able to purchase a Geller projector of good quality, which would reliably project a field 10 m in radius, and which could be disassembled to fit through the bag tears to reach the Town.

We rented a hotel room and got to work.

## Scene 3: Holey in Vein

With the projector assembled in the Town of Lost and Found, we were ready to pick a destination. The locals described a handful of interesting bags:

One which contained an ever-changing procession of books. (Igneous wanted to explore this one.)

One which contained nothing but small birds, flitting endlessly in and out.

One into which a trickle of gold and minor artifacts consistently accumulated; the halfling Townies had been skimming from this one carefully.

One which was used often, and therefore avoided by the skittish halfling Townies, and which had, in the past, been full of clothes, whiskey (not in bottles), a live horse (or most of one), and a pair of lovers loudly mid-copulation.

One which had at times contained powerful artifacts.

Lastly, one which had been unused in recent memory.

We decided to start with the unused bag.

Igneous felt an uncanny agitation as he entered the bag. He was carrying an object like a large collapsing fan, which unfolded into a surface large enough to cast a portal on, though we put that off. M'k sent his Eye into the bag.

When Igneous opened the mouth of the bag, we heard a sound like wind howling through trees, except it was more horrible, like the wind was screaming in pain. Samuel said that this was probably Pandemonium, a chaotic and evil plane of endless caverns, tortured souls, and dangerous creatures. No place, in other words, for worshippers of Vectron and his endless, calm benevolence and snazzy outfits.

M'k send an expendable, less-durable Eye, bearing a tiny LED light constructed by Igneous. The bag was at the bottom of a pit, with nothing around it. The pit was a kilometer and a half deep. At the top, there was more nothing. We withdrew.

## Scene 4: Paladin-n-Out

Our second target was the bag that had contained powerful magic items, including enchanted plate armor. Igneous entered the bag and saw a sheathed daiklave, an extensible rod, some coins, and some rations of food, water, and liquor. He unfolded the fan.

Igneous was ready to send a small camera, but M'k impatiently sent in his fragile Eye. The thing was barely noticeable, right? He'd taken off the LED.

M'k saw a small campsite, with bedrolls surrounding a flickering fire, and a grim-faced elf, who was staring right back. "We're friends!" M'k had time to convey, before the Eye was destroyed.

As M'k recast his spell on Karen's armored eye, Igneous was seized by a creature in shining full plate; if it was human, it was a huge one, and its helm obscured its face. The thing swung a greatsword at Igneous, who teleported out of its grip...somehow? It looked like an Eldarin sort of teleport.

M'k by this point had sent his Eye into the bag and cast his portal, allowing the rest of the party to rush to Igneous' aid. Miley, Samuel, and M'k passed through the portal, immediately repeating M'k's message, "We're friends! We can explain!"

Around the fire stood a female elf with knives and bow, the figure in plate who'd just lost his grip on Igneous, and a human female blearily chanting and waving a magic rod at Igneous, who seemed to barely resist some sort of enchantment.

The party recognized the insignia stamped into the armor: this was a paladin of Cuthbert, god of law and order. With this in mind, M'k straightened his bearing and pronounced that we had visited lawful vengeance upon the thief who had sundered their bag of holding and ours, and who had stolen from all of us. By Vectron's downy wings, we came in peace.

The paladin was unmoved.

The caster read something in his body language. "Wait!"

"We will not deal with devils!" shouted the paladin, as he swung at Miley, who twisted away, evading the sword by a hair's breadth. The locals seemed unaaccustomed to non-daemonfolk with blue skin and hooved feet. Igneous, of course, was hideous enough to pass as a daemon almost anywhere.

The caster chanted again, and Miley fell immobilized to the floor. The wild power of the spell drew static electricity from the warp, which fried all the electronics in the area -- which is to say, all of the gear Igneous brought.

M'k summoned his power and hardened the sphere around his territory, which, though no doubt awesome, might in retrospect not have helped so much to disabuse the paladin of the notion that we were devils.

The ranger threw two knives at M'k, who teleported twice to dodge each in turn.

Samuel repeated M'k message of lawful cooperation in every language he knew.

The paladin again readied his sword against Miley, to the caster's apparent horror.

"Michael, no!"
Miley was suddenly freed, just in time to roll out of the blade's path, though the force of the swing tore through the earth and kicked up debris hard enough to tear gashes in his skin.

The human caster continued, frantically, "Stop, they haven't attacked!" Miley turned and hid behind her.

The elf had Samuel at knifepoint. "Michael, stand down!"

The paladin visibly seethed with fury. "I know you are weak-willed, but this cannot stand!" He swung his sword and finally connected with Miley, grievously wounding him.

The caster chanted again, but this time it was Michael, the paladin, who was frozen in place. Again, however, she had pushed her spell recklessly far beyond the limits of her power, and she tore deeply into the warp; she would have fallen away at right-angles to reality had not Miley grabbed ahold of her arm, wrenching her back, before he fell unconscious from his injuries and exertion.

Michael began to break his enchantment through sheer idiot will. Before he could strike, the sorceress, clearly smitten, dragged Miley into the bag of holding. Samuel followed, exploiting a lapse in the elf's attention, and Igneous teleported behind him.

M'k was loathe to retreat, standing his ground as the paladin recovered his strength and struck for the only remaining target. M'k's shield was not strong enough to stop the hit. Wounded, M'k hesitated for a long moment, trying to figure out how to salvage the situation, before giving up, blinking to the bag, passing through the portal, and closing it behind him.

## Scene 5: Hunt

The caster introduced herself as Janis of Eldbrook. She had a lot of questions for us; her sphere was utterly isolated and unaware of the vast Wheel around them. The answers obviously blew her mind more than a little, and she decided she wanted to learn more of the wider universe before returning home through the bag, although that decision might have had more to with staying near Miley. Mutual life debts apparently create a fast bond.

The bliss daemon within Miley allowed him to heal quickly over the night, taking strength from the embrace of our new companion.

In the morning, we picked another bag to visit: the one with mundane but unpredictable contents, including the horse and the enthusiastic couple. Currently there were meat pies, mugs that must have held mead, and, at the bottom, a pool of mead, which M'k drank with gusto. "Everybody into the fucksack!"

M'k was discouraged from incaution, Igneous instead entering the bag alone, bringing the collapsible surface. Igneous heard galloping horses.

He stuck a camera through the smallest possible opening. The bag's owner rode with other horsemen, hunting on a beautiful mountainside. Luckily, this didn't seem to be another primitive sphere; one of the hunters in view wielded a long las.

We waited until they'd made camp and were cheerfully feasting, and then until they were blitzed on mead, before we exited the bag and made our introductions. This time we sent Samuel in first to do the talking, and we were welcomed with smiles and overflowing mugs.

We were on Ysgard, a chaotic outer plain leaning slightly towards good, and the revellers were Thor worshippers on an infinite hunt. Their quarry were people, which soured our opinions of them, but we bit our tongues and played the gracious guests. The magic of the mountain twisted those on it into either hunters or prey, which was not quite enough of an excuse for our hosts that we would feel bad stealing their bag of holding. We would kill them if it were necessary, and probably even if it weren't. May we be forgiven in Vectron's sapphire gaze.

Ysgard was conveniently close to Wicked Mountains, the sphere holding the tournament, so we could make our way from there. We would need to find another path to Sigil, the portal to Titan's Arm having been one-way only. After a polite stay, long enough to feel our drinks, we parted, promising to visit again. Back in the Town, we planned that visit.

# Session Thirteen: Strongest
### From the logs of M'k

## Scene 1: Bird Bag

We first took a break to investigate another bag. The paladin's bag hadn't been used since we followed Janis through it, but had apparently been sealed closed, so we tried the bag full of birds.

M'k sent in an Eye, seeing a strange, pink forest at night. A humanoid chameleon wore the bag on a rope belt, next to a knife, as he stalked birds. He would periodically pounce on a bird, and stow it. The boundary of the sphere was visible a few hundred meters above, ruling out Samuel's initial guesses of Aborea and the Beastlands.

The Eye died; it wasn't one of the durable ones. A second Eye saw the chameleon climbing towards the ground, before winking out even faster.

This guy didn't look as imposing as the paladin, so we decided to try diplomacy, although we didn't lead with our more diplomatic members, who are also less durable in an ambush.

We assembled the portals, and Doktor stuck his head out of the bag. The chameleon tried and failed to push him back in.

"Hello," Doktor tried, in Trade and Orkish.

In trade, "Ah! You're not a bird! And you can talk! Why are you in my bag?"
Doktor offered to explain, and asked to be let out of the bag. The chameleon instead cast a fireball, which somehow missed Doktor, passed through the bag and portal, and nearly hit Igneous, who dodged aside. The fireball left a trail of birds behind it, for some reason, as it sailed past us and ignited several bags of holding.

Meetslab had pinned the chameleon on the floor, so the rest of us turned to fight the fire, shouting for the halflings to help. We managed to smother the flames, but two bags were lost; we made a note to install a sprinkler system. One bag had been owned by minor adventurers, and popped to reveal a Windhands Gemstone, among some mundane gear. The second lost bag held only rat skulls; the Town hadn't used it since the time it had been full of animate zombies.

The halflings were pretty pissed, and didn't seem to want us to investigate more bags, no matter how much we explained that doing so would further the glory of Vectron, who had after all invented the concept of bags. Regardless, we'd finalized our plans for Ysgard, so it was time to make our way there, and thence to the Wicked Mountains. We left the chameleon unconscious, with his bag hidden on the other side of his sphere.

## Scene 2: Mountain Hop

We made our move in the dead of night, when the hunter's camp was quietest. The bag was full of food and liquor, which we gave to the halflings by way of apology as we filled the bag with our opening statement, an Igneous special: a grenade covered in explosive crystals and shrapnel.

Our hideous friend tossed his device and closed the bag.

When we stormed out of the breach moments later, all (I must assume) screaming "FOR VECTRON!", Samuel was already playing battle music. We saw some twenty hunters laid out on bedrolls around the fire, in range of the bomb, and only one guard. Doktor and M'k started smashing heads, while Igneous picked off targets and Miley fired wildly into the stunned and hung-over crowd. (Remember: they were hunting other people! We're the good guys!)

The first head Doktor tried to smash turned out to be incredibly durable; the human roused from his sleep to pick Doktor up and slam a knee into him. Doktor is even harder to hurt, however, and our melee team soon won the fight, then looked around to see that the camp had been obliterated. Igneous took a sample from the big guy, and Doktor collected the bag.

We were three and a half weeks away from the nearest settlement. Fearing ambush, we retreated into the bag and let our captain make the journey. We visited at night, for s'mores.

While Doktor hiked down the mountain, we ran some errands. Igneous installed a fire suppression system in the Town, among some other projects, while Samuel and M'k tried talking to the chameleon again: he just wanted us to leave him alone, so we did.

## Scene 3: Best in the Wheel

The towns at the foot of the great mountain were pleasant and clean, and filled with cheerful travellers. A bit of a college town vibe.

We managed to find a spelljammer bound for the Wicked Mountains; the captain, Isildur Doomblade, was going to compete. Samuel befriended him, and explained that he travelled with a ridiculously good Warp navigator, likely the most skilled in the Wheel. Samuel offered M'k's assistance in reaching our common destination, and Isildur couldn't turn down help from someone who had once navigated to Sigil without a map. We got rooms for the whole party, except for Igneous, who was hideous enough that we kept him hidden in the Town by habit.

While we waited, we bought more drugs (never don't buy drugs, as Vectron always says), and Samuel made some inquiries. When he explained, to his typical barroom audience, that he was looking for masters of powerful musical styles, he was treated with the story of a bard who started a food-fight in Valhalla; the story ended with him knee-deep in naked valkyries. The bard turned out to be our acquaintance, the leader of Sigil's Infinite Rave, so Samuel would have to look elsewhere for new tricks.

Isildur insisted on pushing for speed, despite M'k's warning that nothing makes one later than being burnt to death and cast into the Warp. Predictably, we ran into a pocket of time dilation, which we found out when we opened the bag and heard Igneous speaking to us at ten times speed (from our vantage point).

Igneous had to keep himself busy while the rest of us travelled in slow motion, but we managed to arrive in the nick of time, a week and a half ahead of the tournament.

## Interlude: A Bored Igneous Is a Dangerous Igneous
### From the logs of Igneous

Thanks to the vagueries of the warp travel, Igneous was forced to wait 16 weeks for his companions to reach The Wicked Mountains.  This was *after* he'd waited three weeks while Doktor Meetslab decended Ysgard Mountain on foot.  (Those weeks had been productive at least: he'd finally gotten his arm the way he wanted it, installed an automated fire suppression system in Lost and Found and had modified his hoverbike to use airplane-style controls.)

Duty before pleasure, he crafted Captain Meetslab's requested daggers first.  The flaming one took to tries, but he got them.

Next, he set out to create a weapon for himself.  A sort of medium-range-las, a long-las variant that traded the extreme range for more raw power.  This didn't work.  Two weeks; two attempts; two failures.

So, five weeks into the waiting, he was feeling quite discouraged about weaponry.  But, he reflected, weapons weren't really his thing.  Sure, he knew some nice tricks with them, but what made him dangerous was his *mind*.  After all, the vast majority of his body count had been achieved with no weapons at all.

But enhancing minds is difficult.  So he took it slowly.  An entire week to build a basic cortical implant, the kind that enables stroke victims to stagger around like poorly animated zombies.  Two weeks (there was a false start, but not so bad as to damage the implant) to attach memory banks with proper protocols.  And one more week to attach processors.

The resulting implant was a thing of beauty.  Well, the design was.  If you just looked at the implant it wasn't very impressive.

But installing it would be trouble.  He needed a trustworthy surgeon.  And that surgeon would need to make incisions...

So he crafted a Power Scalpel.  Technically a weapon (an "ordinary" melee weapon with a power field but unsuited to parrying -- a "common" item, not that you'll find it in stores) but optimized for surgery.

And then he realized that the same issue that affected surgery would also affect drugs.  Power hypodermic needles sounded like a bad idea, so he wanted and injector rig.  First he made one, then, having too much time on his hands, he spent another week upgrading it to be the best injector rig it could be.
Finally it was time for installation.  He and Octocat went to Titan's Arm.  By now her position was secure enough to take a vacation.  He sweetened the deal by offering to make his next project be for her, but suspected that Titan's Arm's 5-star sushi restaurants were sufficient draw after months of soylent.

The discussion at the hospital went something like this...

> Receptionist: Oh, you sweet thing.  What can I do for you?
>
> Octocat: I'm here with my friend Igneous.  He wants some bionics installed.  I'm just keeping him company and making sure people don't freak out at the sight of him.
>
> Receptionist: This is Titan's Arm, darling.  I've seen stranger.  Not often, I'll admit.  And not uglier.  But stranger.  Bionic implantation is easy enough.  Do you already have the implants you want?  You know, we do offer cosmetic surgery as well.
>
> Igneous: Yes, I have the implants.  As for cosmetics, I think in my case that's a lost cause.

Once he had the implants, he took advantage of being at a hospital and bought some drugs.  Detox and Comfort on general principles, Stimm (just in case), Drive (to treat his ADHD), and Slaught (to treat his poor old teacher's Parkinsons).  Either the hospital bought his cover stories or they just didn't care.
Along the way, he noticed some very interesting expeditions were being made into Titan's Arm's interior.  One archeologist claimed to have found a set of multicolored energy beams that seemed to serve as flexor digitalis tendons, and was looking for someone brave or foolish enough to go poke them with a stick.  Heroically, he resisted the temptation and returned to Lost and Found.

The next week, as promised, he crafted a project for Octocat.

Having mostly run out of good ideas, he spent a week upgrading his pet bat, whom he'd named Na.

He was beginning to contemplate a project of building ship-scale cruise missiles with antimatter warheads which could be launched from L&F via Porte and Bag when he got word that the party had emerged from the warp and was readying itself for the tournament.

The observant will note that only 15 weeks are accounted for here, and that counts the Titan's Arm visit as a full week.  The rest of the time was spent in dribs and drabs.  He puttered around the lab, investigating that powerful Ysgardian hunter in far more depth than he deserved.  He looked for signs that the Astral Sea was itself a cellular autamata with a grid structure and inherent alignment.  He didn't find any, which was probably just as well since it would have enabled him to infect space itself with contagious diseases.

## Scene 4: Ante Up

As we emerged from the ship into the docks of Wicked Mountain, the first thing we noticed was that we had probably misinterpreted the word "wicked". The buildings were built with smooth curves and metal rails, and the locals were skateboarding all over everything. A stall sold deep-friend manwiches, which we found to contain neither man nor witches.

As Samuel hit up some bars, for mumbled reasons, the rest of us made our way to the officials' booth. Doktor, M'k, Miley, and Igneous were completing their applications when Dewey revealed himself. We were dumbfounded that he thought he could compete, and we tried to discourage him, but Scrubs was dauntless. We allowed his entry, reasoning that the fights weren't to the death.

The rules: each fighter would ante an artifact, which they (and only they) were allowed to use during the fights. Fighters were not allowed to accept magical assistance or harm a competitor who had already yielded.

In the main bracket, only valuable magical items were accepted, and the winner of each fight would claim the ante of the loser. M'k anted Samuel's Psychic Paper, Miley the magical cat-fall boots, and Igneous the Box of Snakes and the Windhands gemstone. Doktor, who is fucking crazy, put up his heart; he'd had the necrodermis bionic implanted.

There was also a "scrub" bracket, which accepted lesser artifacts; the winners would fill in the 64-person main bracket. We allowed Dewey to enter this one, anteing the Hanging Rope and the data we'd collected from blowing up the ancient human research station. He also asked to borrow the clothes-changing amulet, for some reason.

We asked about the previous tournament: there had been roughly one hundred competitors, and the death rate had been around twenty percent. We looked nervously at Dewey, whose fights in the scrub bracket would take place first.

## Scene 5: Scrubs Bracket

As Dewey approached for his fight, Samuel dashed by, flagrantly in a restricted area, stealing a microphone and vaulting over guards on his way to the center of the arena, where he began to whip up the crowd.

"Ladies and gentlemen! We are all blessed to be here today to witness GREATNESS! To witness a man who has seen the indescribable! Who has fought the unimaginable! Who has survived fights that have killed lesser demigods! He is a slayer of dragons! A man amongst men! I! Give! You! DEWEY! THE SCRUBS!"

Samuel finished introducing the opponent, a drow with twin scimitars, as the security guards caught up with him.

"Sir," intoned the larger, senior guard, "you need to follow us to the announcer's booth."

Samuel continued to introduce the fights.

• Dewey vs. Drow with scimitars

Dewey walked in wearing his ship uniform, and then suddenly was in fatigues and carrying a rocket launcher. Apparently, the Amulet of Expedient Dressing counted weapons as part of the outfit, so long as they were connected with, say, a strap, or a tac harness. Dewey by krak missile. The kid continues to impress. M'k gaped enviously at the amulet.

• Dewey vs. cat girl with claw things

Dewey saved his second missile, instead lobbing grenades. He took some hits, but, Dewey by grenade.

• Dewey vs. Cadian ex-soldier in flak armor, with a bolt gun

Dewey changed outfits again, and was holding Aephyr's crazy sword. "In the words of my captain: WAAAAGH!" Kid's got moxie. Anyway, he cut the bolt gun in half. Dewey by phase sword.

It was pretty shocking to see Dewey go on a tear and reach the main bracket.

## Scene 6: First Round

• Meetslab vs. Sgt. Biceps Strongarm McThews, "The Brawla' from Valhalla".

This guy was amazing: a human nearly as large as the captain. Not nearly as tough, though, or as fast; Doktor killed him before he could even react, setting him on fire with an incendiary knife and then splashing his skull with a greathammer. As the massive flaming headless corpse slumped to the ground, the crowd went wild. Meetslab by hammer, winning an enchanted exercise tape.

• Miley vs. Jeffrold Iris

This guy looked like an anime protagonist: spikey hair, long coat and sunglasses, swords, the works. Miley started by flying some twenty meters in the air; he'd gotten better at taking power from his daemon parasite. But Miley's shots kept missing, as Iris stood stock still, almost posing, and glared. Eventually we noticed that the shots weren't (all) missing, but were passing through him; "his body" was an illusion. Miley recognized this as well, and pulled out his pulse rifles to spray fire around the arena, to no avail. The projection kept glaring, then drew his longer sword, which then began to glow. It screamed, "Blazing Death Strike!" and there was a flash of light, also part of the illusion.

Then James Miley's limbs and head fell off, and he fell to the ground, as we watched in horror.

As the captain collected our friend's corpse, M'k and Igneous managed to spot the opponent, who stood on the far side of the arena, invisible. Coward by pseudo-magic kung fu nonsense.

• Igneous vs. Jenny Multitudes

This one was a Thrikeen with a military loadout: flak over fatigues, rifle and sidearm. Jenny didn't seem so imposing until she split into four copies. We were then of course watching for illusions, but the copies seemed to be solid and real to all our senses. Two Jennies began firing rifles, one threw grenades, and one ran off. Igneous closed the distance and exploded; he'd managed to copy Ben's ability. The one who'd run off a little had spawned a fifth Jenny. Seeing this, Igneous immobilized them all with a web, then he shot one, which melted into ectoplasm; we later learned that she was a daemon, poking fingers into the materium. The other copies, unable to escape and apparently unable to multiply, kept firing approximately in the direction of Igneous, hitting nothing but air. Well, also a few onlookers, including Doktor, though he didn't notice. Igneous reduced a few more bodies to ooze before Jenny conceded. Igneous by web and rifle, winning the Choker of Purest Flame: its magical fire causes burns that do not heal naturally.

• Dewey vs. Sgt. Stabby

It's strange how the ones with "S" names all seem to peak at sergeant. Anyway, this thing looked exactly like the picture of Baron Vash, who we'd been warned was powerful, so Doktor urged Dewey not to fight. Dewey agreed to concede if his remaining missile had no effect. Stabby produced a knife and rolled forward, pricking Dewey in the ankle. Maybe this wasn't, in fact, the fearsome Baron under another name. Dewy didn't even bother with the missile, instead pulling a laser shotcut. Stabby managed to dodge the first shot, nicking another ankle, but the second dismantled him. Dewey by laser shotgun, winning a slab of mithril and a Speaking Mirror (location of paired mirror unknown). Igneous ran out to recover the shards of Sgt. Stabby's memory card.

• M'k vs. Balthazar the Monkey Lord

It was time to win, and to display Vectron's holy Vectron-do, the art of winning fights awesomely, which Vectron invented on the same day he invented combat pajamas. Speaking of which, the opponent wore a gi, corralled spikey hair in a headband, carried a bo staff, and had a monkey's tail. Power sword out, M'k teleported high above Balthazar's head, swung, and missed. Balthazar was too fast. He leapt, five capuchin monkeys appearing around him in flight, and grabbed hold of M'k, biting him and drinking blood. M'k teleported out of the grapple, and he again swung and missed. More monkeys popped into existence, two in the hands of Balthazar, who threw him. One missed, and M'k batted the other aside with a shield.

M'k had expended some magical energy, and was feeling slightly woozy from blood loss, so he teleported a mile in the air to spend a few moments healing bite marks and building power. The view of the mountains from above was magnificent. Squirrel-jumpers were playing tag. Though a ring-out would lose the match, the ring conveniently lacked an upper bound. He teleported back down, not quite where he was before, and waited for his moment.

Balthazar again leapt at M'k, who teleported behind Balthazar and attacked him; Balthazar dodged this shot, and swung a counterattack, which M'k shielded. Just as the fight seemed to be approaching a stalemate, Balthazar threw his staff, striking M'k in the forehead and knocking him out. Balthazar by staff.

*****

We had a day before the next round of fights, with some healing provided. Janis was distraught and in shock at James' death, and didn't seem long for the group, assuming we could unseal the paladin's bag. We took Miley's body to the Tau embassy on Titan's Arm, for a proper funeral. His people convinced us that he would have wanted his body donated to science.

## Scene 7: Second Round

The remaining rounds would be fought on the peak of a mountain. Front-row spectators watched through panels of transparent aluminum provided by Igneous, who had a thing about innocents being mown down needlessly.

• Igneous vs. Dewey

An unfortunate matchup, but at least Igneous would probably avoid killing Dewey. The two squared off. Igneous dangled his weapon from his fingers. "You know what I can do with a sling and a coin. It's time to yield." Dewey screamed, "Quoth the captain: WAAAAGH!" and threw two grenades, which missed, and which would have hurt dozens of bystanders if not for the aluminum plating. Igneous struck Dewey with a coin in such a way as to disable a limb, then webbed him in place, then disabled another limb. Dewey would never concede, but eventually went unconscious. Igneous by web, sling, and coin.

• Meetslab vs. John the Gunslinger

Typical gunslinger type, this one. His paired revolvers were apparently magical: when he got off the first two shots, Doktor fell on his ass, though he wasn't harmed. Doktor replied by throwing two knives, one electrified and one on fire, while advancing. This repeated until John was full of knives and conceded. Doktor by throwing knives, winning the Riding Horse, a hobby horse toy that becomes a real horse when given the command word ("Giddy up!").

## Scene 8: Round of 16

• Igneous vs. Lizzit

Lizzit was either a tiefling or a poorly-disguised daemon. She brought no weapons. Igneous webbed her and shot her. Lizzit said, "Walk out of the ring." Igneous walked out of the ring. Lizzit by enchantment.

• Meetslab vs. Tom Adio

"I want to be the best!" said the scrawny fourteen-year-old expy. "Snorglemorfin! I choose you!" The beast attacked Doktor to little effect; Doktor responded, wounding the hideous thing. Adio tried to catch Doktor in a pokeball, direly underestimating him. Doktor swung his greathammer at Adio, reducing his organs to paste, and went on to knock one of Snorglemorfin's limbs clean off, leaving it to bleed to death pitiably. Meetslab by hammer, winning a pokeball.

## Scene 9: Quarter Finals

• Doktor vs. Balthazar the Monkey Lord

Balthazar immediately got a grip on Doktor, biting him. Doktor struggled to take control, shocked by the strength of the little vampire monkey guy. Balthazar's second bite was a mouthfull of armor; conversationally, he told Doktor, "You're really crunchy, you know that?"

Doktor was shaking with rage as Balthazar took another bite, and the two rolled on the floor, reversing positions, stabbing each other with teeth and electrified knives respectively, capuchin monkeys occasionally appearing from nowhere and doing nothing in particular.

Finally, Doktor, now in dominant position, struck a solid blow, taking a finger off and rendering that hand useless. Balthazar switched tactics, attempting to magically dominate Doktor: "Flee!" Doktor was able to resist, though, and took the opportunity to stave in Balthazar's chest, though as an obvious vampire he wasn't really dead. Meetslab by hammer, winning one year of Balthazar's service. Doktor bowed to the "corpse" that was handed to him.

We learned that Balthazar was the son of a human and a monkey god. He had been left on a human world, which was shortly overrun by monkeys, its ecosystem destroyed. Balthazar was found by a spelljamming crew and has been wandering the Wheel, wreaking havoc, ever since. We would need to find a way to deal with the monkeys, during his year of service. Balthazar was uninterested in the Psychic Paper he'd won, trading it back to Samuel in exchange for cargo shorts with secure locks on the pockets; he liked to make some effort to keep his monkeys contained.

## Scene 10: Semi Finals

A prize was awarded to everyone who'd reached this round. The choices were a hat with a propeller on it, a hat that looked like a penguin's head, a star-shaped bauble that twinkled invitingly, and a large red-orange flower that was warm to the touch. We took the fire flower, for which Sleepy Pete had offered a bounty.

• Meetslab vs. Jeffrold Iris

Doktor had told us not to cheat, but when Iris entered the ring already invisible, we figured it was only tit-for-tat to give Doktor her location (the real Iris was a female elf). Doktor immediately pounced, pinning the invisible figure and covering her mouth, to prevent the use of most magic. He then slit her throat, avenging James Miley. Doktor by knife, winning a straight razor, engraved "BRS", which cuts directly into the target's platonic essence: wounds from it cannot be healed by any means. Doktor held it at a distance, terrified, and instructed Igneous to seal it in molten steel and to destroy it at the first opportunity.

## Scene 11: Grand Finals

• Meetslab vs. Lizzit

Lizzit's enchantment failed against the legendary willpower of our captain, who grappled with the tiefling and pushed her out of the ring. It was somewhat anticlimactic, even with Lizzit screaming as she careened down the side of the mountain, bouncing painfully for several hundred meters before being caught in the safety net. Doktor by ring out, winning a ruby containing a living reptilian eye, which glowed orange and saccaded alertly. The bound entity was powerful, upper greater daemon to angelic tier, although its identity wasn't known, beyond Tzeentchian alignment. It came with an incantation to release it, though it would not grant control of the daemon.

Doktor Meetslab also won the Strongest Under the Heavens championship belt, which looked like a boxing championship belt with a space to tie a black belt on sideways. It would grant him extra strength, so long as he actually held the title of Champion and Most Rad.

*****

There was some time to rest and grieve. We ran into Isildur, who had survived his defeat in the early rounds. Samuel invited us to a taven, which he promised would lift our spirits, though he was clearly hiding something.

## Scene 12: Under the Table

The Wicked Fountains was doing brisk business, with the town full of partying spectators, a few successful fighters who already sold their winnings, and a fair few more combatants looking to forget their troubles. As we arrived, Samuel stumbled towards a small stage, acting as though already drunk, and took hold of a microphone.

"Welcome, my, uh, my friends! And welcome! To the Liquid Dojo! You see before you Champion Most Rad Commodore Doktor Meetslab, here to take on all comers!"

"Ste-*hic*, step right up to compete in the ultimate competition after the ultimate competition! First round, shots! Getting weaker as they go! I mean, stronger!"

"Second round, drinking challenges! Challenges will draw lots, and the winner propose a challenger, or vice versa, and then the worst at the...the, the thing, will lose. And then another challenge! And so, well, etcetera!"

"Welcome, to the Strongest! Under! The Table!"

The competition began with 120-proof shots provided by Whiskeyed Mountains Distillery, a sponsor found on short notice; other sponsors provided successively stronger beverages, including local special Djinn's Antonic, which could reach nearly 400 proof on an auspicious equinox. There were more entrants for the drinking contest than there had been for the actual fights, but most bowed out, or were dragged away, by the time twenty shots had been served, each leaving behind their exorbitant entrance fee. There were two hundred drinks served in the first round.
Only four still stood: a flamboyantly-dressed gnome, an aasimar with the smell and proportions of a steakhouse, Samuel, and Doktor Meetslab. Samuel was acting even drunker than before, but seemed limitless; Doktor barely held onto consciousness, despite the covert help of M'k's power.

Samuel went first. "I challenge you to the greatest drunken competition of all: karaoke!"

The crowd voted by cheers. Doktor lost handily.

The aasimar went next, proposing a chugging contest. The gnome was out.

"With only two drinkers remaining, the final challenge will, um. The challenge will," Samuel swayed dramatically on the spot, "will be issued by an impartial party, and who better to have the honor than, than the Champion Most Rad! Wooooo!"

Doktor, who was not impartial but who hadn't actually planned how to exploit this conflict of interest, went with his gut. "Fucking...vampire's filling us with monkeys. Filling place. You need to...you catch monkeys. Most monkey wins!" Monkey-wrangling probably isn't a traditional drinking game in most places, but the judge was the crowd, and they roared with pleasure as the aasimar crashed through tables and walls to seize the animals in twos and threes.

Amid the chaos, Samuel calmly walked to the stage and picked up his guitar. He began to play an ancient song, beloved by monkey and ape alike. "Here, here, here we go..."

When after a minute or two the aasimar caught the last monkey, his fourteenth, Samuel had at least twenty clinging to him. The aasimar raised Sam's hand in victory, and they had several celebratory rounds together.

Samuel counted his winnings. Having woken up as the humblest in means of the crew, he was now far and away the wealthiest. Also, he had some darksteel pistol ammo. Neat.

He bought Dewey some presents, including power armor and all the frag missiles he could want, which helped to make up for M'k subsequently taking away the Amulet of Expedient Dressing. M'k walked off giddily, planning all the outfits he could finally wear, now that he could store both clothing and implement in a single item while he teleported. Praise Vectron!

# Session Fourteen: Size Differentials
### From the logs of Igneous

This is a series of bag-explorations, for which thorough notes were not kept.

## Scene 1: Bigger

We investigated the bag with gold, which was in some sort of dark, warm, moving organic structure.  Seeing danger, Doktor Meetslab insisted on doing first reconnaissance solo.  This proved possibly mistaken, as he suddenly found himself coughed out.  Worse, the cough inverted the bag, cutting him off from aid.  Worst, the creature that coughed him out was a dragon, roughly 128 times his size.

After a long time of getting batted around like a cat toy, Doktor summoned up all his diplomacy and convinced the dragon that he was more useful alive.  If she would simply agree to swallow him whole, he would return with treasure.  She agreed, but first placed a variant geas on him to in fact deliver the treasure.  The spell lasted longer than a normal geas, but could not force him to take self-destructive actions, and made no attempt to protect itself from rules-lawyering.

As an afterthought, Doktor asked the dragon's name.  She answered only that she was The Dragon Queen.

## Scene 2: Smaller

We found a bag full of civilized, medieval-tech, sentient mice.  They had cultivated a flower that grew wraithbone (Igneous made a note to both jumblemorph it into himself and conventionally transfect it into some kudzu for faster growth).

They were very impressed with jarred peanut butter.  Trade will be easy.

They also knew a Sword School optimized for fighting larger creatures.  There wasn't time for any of us to learn it, but their greatest warrior, named Tim, agreed to come with us to fight the dragon in return for our support to his community (this will likely involve aerosalizing irrigation systems).

## Scene 3: Exactly the Size It Means to Be

We found a bag in mechanus.  Not willing to risk giving modrons access to Lost and Found, we recovered it with a Gate.  We also took a small sample of mechanus assimilating oil, kept in a low-tech glass jar surrounded by a kilometer of hard vacuum.

## Scene 4: Mind-Bogglingly Large

We found a bag in a Great Library.  The collection of knowledge was so vast that it warped the internal geometry of the sphere.  It also gently pushed the minds of all present to contemplate the big questions, which in turn drove them to drink.  We weren't there long enough to be affected.

Despite the natural hazards, the inhabitants of the library were quite friendly.  So long as we didn't make trouble or misshelve books, we were welcome to return and research any time.

## Scene 5: The Harder They Fall

The first treasure we returned to the Dragon Queen was a short-fused ship-scale microtorpedo coated in gold paint.  It mysteriously failed to explode.

(Later we discovered that the entire sphere had techbane properties.  Fortunately (?) microtorpedos are fission-based and fail safe, rather than antimatter-based which fail dangerous.)

Somehow, we'd known this wasn't going to work.  Things this easy never do.  So we fought.

She'd known we were going to try something, and sent a golem duplicate to receive the treasure, while she lurked invisibly on the roof.  But Balthazar only needed a mouthfull of the golem's fluids to declare "It's a fake!", and Igneous's native sonar spotted the real dragon.

From there, it was just a matter of dealing fatigue until she dropped.  And then slashing until she didn't get up.

# Session Fifteen: Returning
### From the notes of Igneous

## Scene I: Returning the Dragon Queen's Flesh to the Wheel's Ecosystem

With the Dragon Queen dead and visible, she seemed smaller than when active and fighting.  Only the size of a small house.  About 500 metric tonnes.  A "full size" refrigerator can hold between 0.2 and 0.9 tonnes of meat, if you remove the shelves and stuff it perfectly.  Purchasing and transporting several hundred refrigerators would not be impossible, but it would certainly be unpleasant.  Such a system would also require roughly a hundred kilowatts -- more than standard wiring.  And it might not even have run in the Throne, which suffered from a planer effect that hampered electronics.

Instead, we chose to move the corpse to the cold.  The cold in question was a high-altitude glacier in the Wicked Mountains.  The transport involved the Gate spell, so first the flesh needed to be carved into hexagonal prisms that could be fed through it.  We carefully removed the bones, organs and scales, then set out to carve the muscles.  With a power sword, power scalpel, Black Blade of Disaster, and extensive knowledge of both anatomy and geometry, we managed.

Leaving the final carving in the hands of others, Igneous travelled to the Wicked Mountains in search of a stable glacier.  The Radical Monks were only vaguely aware of the internal structure of the mountains.  But they did know where the best hot pools were.  They had invented an extreme sport that combined snowboarding, stripping and high-diving.  Naturally, this worked best with hot water.  Feeling cautious, Igneous chose not to trust the map, and made a brief side-trip to Titan's Arm for a ground-penetrating sonar.  Thus equipped, he flew his hoverbike to a promising region of mountains and began surveying.

## Scene 2: Returning Janis to her Homeworld

It seemed unkind to make Janis wait while we completed the butchery.  So M'k forced open the bag to her realm with Improvised Magic, and Doktor went through to ensure she could arrive safely.  He expected this to be reasonably straightforward: a quick punch to that idiot paladin's face and a quick handoff.

Instead he found himself at the bottom of a deep pit with zombie archers shooting down at him.  One of them even managed to deal damage, owing mostly to extreme luck.  Still, Doktor leapt out of the pit with his jump pack and slaughtered the zombies trivially.  Another zombie dropped on him and attempted grapple, but he ripped it in two out of sheer contempt.  Soon he found the necromancer who was responsible for the zombies, who ordered all his forces to converge and kill the intruder.  Had they converged at once, they might have achieved something by sheer numbers, though even that is doubtful.  As it was, Doktor made quick work of the would-be zombie lord.

## Scene 3: Returning the Platonic Razor to Its Original Owner, Except Not

As he completed the geologic survey, Igneous noticed something very strange.  A human-sized blob of 1g/cc material was moving through a solid andesite region, leaving no trail.  Furthermore, it seemed to be heading straight towards him.  The auspex confirmed it as magical, but provided no details.  Igneous radiod word to his party, and stepped back giving the thing space to emerge.

It was indeed a humanoid possessed of some strange magic.  The conversation went something like this:

> Sanguin: Hello, friend.  My name's Brian Sanguin and I'm a professional assassin.  I'm looking for Doktor Meetslab.  Are you a friend of his?
> 
> Igneous [relaying everything via radio]: Yes
> 
> Doktor [over radio]: Let me handle this guy
> 
> Sanguin: Could you tell me where he is?
> 
> Igneous: He's busy at the moment, but I'm sure if I ask he'll be happy to come and fight you as soon as he's done
>
> Sanguin: I'm an assassin.  I don't want to fight him.  I want to kill him.  And no warning him about me -- hand over that comm bead.

Igneous handed over the bead, relaying the fact that he'd done so via the other radio concealed in his arm and wired directly to his nervous system.  It even used his primary vocoder for proper voice subtlety.

> Sanguin: Now I need you out of the way.  I'd rather not kill you, because I'm not getting paid to and work without pay is too much like charity for my tastes.  So here's some drugs that'll knock you out.  Please just take them.
>
> Igneous: I'm not in the mood for drugs.  How about I just get back to my geological survey and out of your way?
>
> Sanguin: No way.  I'm not leaving you here doing who-knows-what.
>
> Igneous: I'll explain it.  The mountains are a pretty standard andescitic structure...

Igneous failed to convince Sanguin that geology was an interesting subject, but he did manage to keep talking until Doktor Meetslab arrived in a great hurry.  At that moment, Sanguin stabbed Igneous with a tranq needle and dived into the ice.

Irritated at being drugged, Igneous enhanced his dodging skill and stood ready for when Sanguin re-appeared.

The battle that followed was deeply frustrating.  Sanguin popped in and out of reachable space (though he remained trackable via auspex.  He was extremely capable of dodging, but so was Igneous.  For several rounds, nothing was achieved.  M'k arrived, and hit Sanguin with Unluck, a potent but not crippling curse.

In the midst of this, Sanguin revealed that he was the original owner of the platonic razor, which Idris stole from him to ante into the Strongest under Heaven tournament.  He was very emotionally attached to the razor, and very distressed at the idea that it might be destroyed.  Why was not clear.
Eventually Doktor began to consider returning the razor if Sanguin promised to kill Moloch-Zur with it, a rather risky plan (it would have revealed Lost and Found to Sanguin, and risked Moloch-Zur somehow corrupting him).  In any case, it was not to be.  Igneous was too angry to cease fire, and when Sanguin was distracted handing Doktor a letter of recommendation, Igneous finally struck him with a pushed Drain Energy.

It was a perfect combination: Samael's music boosting Igneous's attack, M'k's Unluck sabotaging Sanguin's save, and Igneous's own pushing creating a devastating amount of magic.  Sanguin went from untouched to down in an instant.

He did try to dodge into the ground, but was a bit too slow.  He phased and then passed out, and fell straight to the center of the world.  The large-scale geology of the Wicked Mountains is unclear, but some form of molten core seems likely.  In any case, he did not return.

Igneous's push triggered a psychic phenomenon, but the wraithbone he'd grown in his heart did its job, and those present felt nothing more than a vague unease waft at their minds.

(For a few seconds before this, Samael had been radioing about zombies in Lost & Found, so Igneous and M'k went there to help, leaving Doktor to guard the bag.)

The letter of recommendation was an interesting document.  It contained phrases like "He's a good friend, and was very useful to us, but I've ordered all my soldiers to shoot him if he ever returns".  

Shortly thereafter, a spelljammer came into line-of-sight and dropped a landing shuttle.  Aboard it was an ominous vampire catgirl, also an assassin, who had transported Sanguin here on a promise of entertainment.  Words were exchanged between Doktor and the catgirl, and now she has joined our crew.
Once the zombie matter was dealt with, Igneous returned with some corrogated sheet metal and built a hut on a stable patch of glacier, and Samuel rallied the halflings to move the meat there.  The meat was coated in plastic pallet wrap to prevent frostbite.

## Scene 3: Returning Janis's World to Intact Status

The zombies from Janis's world had indeed entered Lost & Found, and were coping moderately well with microgravity.  This was not normal zombie behavior.  Even so, they had only been moderately threatening to Samuel, and were entirely unprepared for the more violent members of our team.

Igneous and M'k went in to the bag, while Dewey and Samuel stood guard at the L&F end.  They were immediately but ineffectively attacked by zombies.  Igneous pulled out his auspex and got to work understanding what made these zombies smarter than normal, while M'k chopped some heads or something.  The zombie's continuing attempts to bite Igneous slowed the work somewhat, but eventually Doktor showed up and held its mouth closed.

Eventually it became clear that these zombies were raised with a variant of the Raise Dead spell, which enabled the raiser to push bits of his mind onto them.  Whenever he gave them a command, he imprinted his understanding of what he wanted, which included things like "How to use a bow" or "That's a portal, you can go through it".  This did leave them somewhat vulnerable to commands from other commanding individuals (with commanding mustaches), but not usefully so.  It seems plausible that a high level enchanter could have taken control of them, since this sort of mind-imprinting is what they do, but without one at hand, we destroyed the last zombies and moved on.
On further searching, we found the paladin in a deep pit.  He wasn't at the bottom, but halfway up, standing on a pile of dead zombies and clearly hoping more would show up to attack him.  After some deliberation, we let down a rope.  Doktor tried to explain the difference between "funny-looking" and "devil", but the paladin still wasn't listening, and insulted Smiley.  So Doktor punched him.  But somehow this resulted in greater respect and understanding, rather than a fight to the death.

We learned that the world had been devastated by this necromancer.  His zombies might be individually weak, and his backup plan nonexistant, but so long as he was controlling the shape of the encounter, his well-organized zombie army could crush enemies piece by piece, and grow much faster than any conventional force.  A higher tech world would likely have shut this down by converging quickly and using area-effect weapons, but these low-tech spaces are terribly vulnerable.

After some discussion, we transported the paladin to the nearest intact town, left Janis there as well, allowed them to keep the bag, and even gave them a laser shotgun and a grenade.

## Scene 4: Returning the Dragon Queen's Knowledge to the Rightful Possession of the Academic Community

With the Dragon Queen's corpse out of the way, we investigated her hall.  Mostly she had a giant hoard of gold and jewels.  Amidst it, she had a book, locked shut with a clasp.

We immediately suspected it was her spellbook, and Doktor immediately deduced it was booby-trapped.  A quick check with the auspex found tens of thousands of adjurations on it.

Operating on standard containment protocols, we moved the more vulnerable treasure away from the book, then ourselves retreated to Lost and Found.  Igneous sent a camera drone to watch, and a Lesser Servant to act on his behalf.

The clasp on the book was unopenable (at least to mundane efforts), but the cover could be cut with an ordinary knife, bypassing the clasp.  It seemed that every single character in the book was an exploding rune, a task which required some rather elaborate serifs.  Fortunately, exploding runes only explode when read.  Photographing them, then passing the photos through a compress/store/load/decompress/display/read cycle merely consists of reading something visually similar but magically null.  So the servant flipped pages while the drone photographed.

The book contained several golemmancy spells (enough to reconstruct the art) and a fourth level abjuration that empowers an object to cast a spell.  The latter spell was limited enough that it probably can't be used to cast itself, and even if it could, that might not succeed in draining the warp of energy and leaving demons flapping helpless like fish in a desert.  Still, something to think about.

In any case, Igneous made a mental note to get the book printed on ordinary paper and contribute it to the Great Library.

## Scene 5: Return to the Mirror

Back at the Strongest Under Heaven tournament, Dewey won a communications mirror and a block of mithril by defeating a rather frail roomba from the Vash Barony.  We concluded that the Baron Vash spent a giant block of mithril just to get this mirror into the hands of a competitor.  Knowing how important Baron Vash might be to our future plans, we... got distracted by a dragon.

But back to the mirror!

As victor, Dewey had the honor of looking in it first, while Doktor hovered behind him.

Both froze.

Igneous used Detect Thoughts to figure out what was going on in Doktor's mind.  For a fleeting instant he experience the Total Ego Death that had his crewmates trapped.  But just before he gave up on all sense of self, he managed to shut down the connection.  It seemed the mirror contained a potent cognitohazard.

After waiting a few minutes in which nothing changed, Igneous covered the mirror with a blanket.  Doktor, being heroically strong-willed, snapped out of it.  Dewey did not.

We later learned that a "shock to the soul" might reset Dewey.  Options for this might involve vampiric feeding (though the standard version is fatal), some form of soul music, true love (which is touching souls), or dark magic (which we do not currently possess).

We also later realized that the mirror was not targetted at "a competitor", but at us, or perhaps at Doktor Meetslab.  We weren't even sure if we were the Baron's enemies, though we certainly are now.  It is unlikely that he managed to find us, having nothing to start from but a vague query.  It is even more unlikely that he arranged for us to get the mirror via ordinary manipulation.  If nothing else, the tournament seeding was random.  This suggests some powerful probability- or fate-manipulation magic.  Possibly powered by a god or greater demon.  This magic, along with the soul magic, would be worth acquiring.

But after all that successful manipulation, how did he fail at the end?  Did something about the captain keep the fate-manipulation at bay?  Or did it not fail?  Did he do exactly the damage he intended?

In any case, we became reluctant to tarry -- and hoped to arrive at the Vash Barony before he expected us or had the chance to prepare further.

## Scene 6: Return to Sigil

We knew roughly where a Siglian door was, so M'k took his bag of holding and started wandering under archways with eyes closed and tongue out until he reached Sigil.  And for some time thereafter, since apparently the traffic noises, proper flooring and less echoy space didn't alert him to the transition.  He did notice crashing tongue-first into a trellis of decorative razor-vine, from which he quickly healed.

We sealed the Dragon Queen's fortress with simple steel doors, left the bag there, and all traveled to Sigil.

We first checked on our Whale, which had been parked for nearly half a year.  At the dock, we met Frank Earnest, Chosen of Malal who explained that he wanted to help us.  We were all well aware that Malal's code strictly forbids helping, and were somewhat confused.  Doktor did not wait for clarity, but charged.  He did enough damage that Frank would have died had his Chosen powers not kicked in.

As Frank did not fight back, Doktor began to suspect this was some sort of manipulative trap.  He let Frank go.  Frank gave us his phone number and a warning: The Lady of Pain is coming, and you should probably move your ship.

We evacuated the crew and pokeballed the whale.

## Scene 6: Returning Treachery for Treachery

Alta confirmed that Frank had been extremely helpful, so Doktor agreed to meet him nonviolently at a cafe.  M'k and Samuel went with him, while Igneous watched from a sniper perch just in case.  Despite M'k's interfearence, Samuel managed to draw Frank into a personal conversation.  Frank admitted to having done horrible things in the past, insisted that he only wanted to be helpful now, acknowledged that the Commandments of Malal were exactly what we thought, and refused to explain beyond "theology is complicated".

Eventually Igneous commented over the comms, "If Malal is about backstabbing allies, and Malal is his ally, then is he backstabbing Malal by being nice?  I still don't see how he isn't smote for that."

Samuel chose not to steer the conversation in this direction, but his active listening elicited the key insight anyway: "Commandments aren't rigid.  You can break them so long as you're following the core principle enough.  The key principle of Malal is the subversion of friendship."

And our newest crew member got it: "All this helping is permitted because it is in the service of a greater subversion."

This leaves a lot of questions open.  How does this "in the service of a greater" effect work?  Pelor is notorious of rejecting cruelty for the sake of a greater good, and likewise Cuthbert lawbreaking for a greater justice.  Though one expects Dr Catastrophei would be ok with experimentation with faith.  Does it vary by god?  It can't be a direct decision, or Tiamat would have found an excuse not to be ok with seeking power by overthrowing her.

Is subverting Malol's will enough?  Usually followers of Malal hurt their teammates.  Or does this kindness actually hurt Malol, in some strange, metaphysical way?

Does he have a plan to eventually kill Malol?  What will happen if he succeeds?

Does he ever take a break from his big betrayal to betray somebody local?  Followers of Pelor have been known to delay high-stakes quests for random acts of kindness.

Perhaps we will find some of these answers later.  More likely not.

## Scene 7: Return to Sleepy Pete's

Immediate mysteries solved, we paid a visit to Sleepy Pete's Mixed Meats and Minced Fingers.  Doktor Meetslab handed over as much dragon meat as Pete had refrigerator space for (and possibly the fire-flower as well?).  Pete celebrated by cooking up a giant bowl of dragon stew for us, which boosted our max hp.

After the stew, we found ourselves in a bit of a time-crunch, so we scattered to our various errands.  Doktor travelled to Titan's Arm with our pokeballed ship (newly named "Whalord") where spending money like water enabled him to purchase defensive upgrades very quickly.  Samuel found a mithrilsmith on Sigil, who crafted for him a mithril and dragonbone guitar.  Igneous ran assorted errands, including checking the locations of the bags, running a fiberoptic cable from Sigil to Titan's Arm, investigating the Ex-Dragon Throne's techbane properties, and some light reading in the Great Library.

And, thus, in less than a week, we were ready to head to the Vash Barony.  Route TBD.

# Editor's Note

It is at this point that the story proper ends.  Not because of events within it, but because further detailed logs could not be obtained.  But two of our heroes did leave final memoirs...

# Epilogue: Igneous

The trip to the Vash Barony was a great success.

First the trip itself (via Gehenna and Baator), which Igneous spent bouncing around Lost and Found setting up the Interinternet. He didn't even come out of the bag at Baator, where Samuel diplomatically bought a map and that was it. He even organized the wheel's first telepresence-based inter-sphere scientific conference, at which major advances were made in science-magic interaction, and inter-sphere telepresence technology got a good load-test.

Then the Vash Barony, where our heroes slew the Baron, freeing his people. Igneous then dug carefully through his electronic memory and found key insights into both Soul and Fate Magic.

The collective scholarship of the wheel cracked the hawking rune problem. The runic medium needed a certain metaphysical weight, which could be achieved either by raw mass or by life-sustainingness. The latter was achievable by deriving from the platonic form of food. So Igneous modified the horn of eternal soylent to produce ncRNA in the shape of the needed runes (and established a proper aquaculture system for Lost and Found).

So the pieces were now in place for Darkforge II. Jenny provided the black hole (with the resources of a dozen spheres at hand, everyone has a price). The horn provided a continual flow of runic arrays. A standard Titan's Arm based tractor beam pulled macroscopic darksteel to a safe orbit. By default, the system produced small flat plates, suitable for armor (they could be overlapped and sovereign glued if desired, or implanted as bionic-style scales, which we did for Whalord). With Vash's fate-magic, it could produce anything. 

So Doktor Meetslab finally achieved his goal, exalting as the first darksteel prometheon in living memory.

(Igneous was tempted to experiment on his soul in transit, but there was no control group.)

Shortly thereafter, the crew received an emergency message from Captain Maximillion Nero, who forced his bag's zipper and tossed a radio beacon into Lost and Found. A key subfleet under his command had defected to the demons. Mind-magic was suspected. He needed reinforcements immediately or all the wheel would fall, and only our crew could make it in time.

He expected a handful of powerful warriors. He got a darksteel-clad spacewhale. And a darksteel promethon. And a goblin who could turn invisible, swim through enemy shields, pull microtorpedos on time-detonators out of a bag of holding, crazy-glue them to enemy hulls, and portal back before discovery. The wheel was saved.

Seeing how precarious life in the materium had become, Igneous made a deal with the shipwrights of Titan's Arm. Soon the entire Vanguard Fleet was armored in darksteel.

But Igneous had become too prominent. On the interinternet, no one knows you're a hideous abomination. And Craft(polite email) is wis-based, not cha-based. Soon people realized that Igneous, the ambitious, conference organizing scholar with a strong interest in fate-magic and general relativity was the same person as the mysterious benefactor who delivered a stream of darksteel to Titan's Arm who was also the same person as the infamous Igneous von Darkforge. In hindsight, a psueudonym might have been wise.

The governments of the wheel began to gather a fleet to catch him. Maximillian talked them out of it. True, young Igneous had done a terrible thing. But adult Igneous had made awesome restitution. And the wheel needed him.

The governments accepted this logic. The Omnissian Church did not. They did assemble and send a fleet.

Various allies offered to help, but Igneous refused them all. He had to do this himself. He did allow Samuel to help upgrade the oratory routines in his vocoder, but sent him away for the actual confrontation.

He met the fleet in empty space outside Titan's Arm. No allies. No spelljammer. No weapons.

It was no contest. The Omnissians didn't understand their ships. So their attempts to close buffer overflows in the comms systems were nowhere near the level a thriving academic culture could produce. With his first message he turned off their weapons systems.

His second message was to the people.

“Yes, I am Igneous von Darkforge.

“Yes, I killed twenty thousand innocent people. Your people. I didn't mean to, and I am very sorry, and I know that isn't enough. I can't bring them back, but I can spend the rest of my life saving people.

“Starting with you. I turned off your weapons. I could have turned off your life support. I estimate there's twenty thousand crew in that armada, whom I just spared. Maybe you could call that even?

“I'd really recommend it, because you're in a terrible bind. I am an advanced piece of technology. Organic nanotechnology, but technology nonetheless. I'm swimming through space. I can pass sphere boundaries. I breath fire without a fuel source. And I do all these things because I made myself into a thing that can do them. I am advanced technology, and by your own oaths you cannot destroy me.

“But I can destroy you. Maybe wipe you from half the spheres in the wheel and compare progress with and without you. Maybe I should do that.

“But I'm not going to. I don't have to, so long as I can find other mysteries to investigate, and the wheel isn't short on those.  And I don't want to, because I realize most of you are trying to do what's right, and I'm sick of watching innocent people die.

“So here's how it's going to be. You're going to leave me alone, and I'll leave you alone. I'll learn new things. You'll preserve the old. I'll save innocent lives as the opportunity presents itself. And you'll count my debt as paid.

“It will be like that. Because you have no alternative.”

They had no alternative. They slunk off into the void.

And Igneous? He never settled in one place for long. He handed off his conference organization duties to better-suited people, and popped from scientific mystery to mystery. For a very, very long time.

# Epilogue: Doktor Meetslab

The good Doktor hefted the huge, heavy crate on the ground and popped it open with casual ease. A cacophony of motes danced above the surface of the sea of metallic black plates contained within. He picked one up, holding it up to his eye to observe the relatively small imperfections on the surface. He looked at what he had accepted as his new spelljammer, Whalord was half covered in black scales, and would be completely covered in a week.

Meetslab focused for a bit, causing the layer of fake skin to liquefy and retreat into ports on his body and seal up, revealing his pitch black robotic body. It was everything he could've hoped for and more, to say that Igneous had outdone himself would be a vast understatement, he had lost virtually nothing in the transition, retaining his sense of touch, taste and smell, and gained the ability to look like either his old self or a Darksteel humanoid according to his whimsy.

It was everything he ever wanted, but... 

At some point it stopped being his. Igneous had made the creation of Darksteel much more attainable for everyone, and getting in the way of that to feel special would be the height of foolishness. 

Doktor shook his head, he was missing something, it was just a matter of figuring out what.

## Captain's log, day 336

> I have accelerated my studies. Igneous's time has become too valuable to waste so I found different tutors. I have been learning magic, namely Transmutation and Abjuration. I was recommended Conjuration over Transmutation, but I refused, the answer is there, I know it.

## Captain's log day 338

> Frank Earnest came over today, and invited him over to talk. We discussed plans for retaking Cadia, but they were all hollow speculation as none of us had recent data on the state of the old space station. We both agreed that recon had to be done at some point. 

## Captain's log day 341

> I have learned Swift Change and Dedication. They're both moderately useful, I guess. Changing in and out of Power Armor or Warstrider in a second was a neat party trick if nothing else. 

## Captain's log day 344

> Maximillian called, we responded. He got much more then he asked for. Retaking Vanguard was easy. I tentatively prodded him about retaking Cadia. Ok, well I made Samuel do it, he was better at selling the idea to him. He response was non-comital, while he thanked us for the help he didn't think our assistance would be nearly enough for such a monumental task. What could we do? We left.

## Captain's log day 345

> I'm not happy. Nero telling us we weren't good enough bothers me. I'll show him. 

## Captain's log, day 347

> I've decided on the Magic Fang spell, a classic among Druids. With it I could enhance my Chainfist and Blinky's bite to bypass armor. Useful, yet still not quite what I need. I'm getting close though.

## Captain's log, day 352

> I've been reclusive lately, I never get tired or feel discomfort or get hungry or thirsty or need to use the bathroom. When Dewey knocked on my door I was annoyed at being interrupted, or at least I was until he nervously informed me that I had spent a full 67 hours studying non stop. I thought he was making a joke, but it was true. Apparently my crew had taken my "do not interrupt" sign very seriously and only Dewey had been brave enough to ignore that. 

## Captain's log, day 353

> I threw away the sign out of embarrassment and Put a Chrono with an alarm in my room. Still, I have made good progress and invented a combination hastening and lightening spell. I'm close to a breakthrough... I just need Igneous to make a couple of modifications to myself and Whalord, if I'm right about this...

Dewey looked worriedly at the hollow look on his captain's face, in his hand he clutched a bag of holding filled to the brim with silver dust. "Uh, um, cap'n?"

"Yes Dewey?"

"What's the uh, what's the silver dust for?"

"Dedication."

"That's a lot of silver dust..."

"Yes."

They both stared awkwardly for a second. Dewey stole a nervous glance at his mustache and broke the silence first. "So what're you going to do with Dedication?"

"I have had an idea." At that proclamation a chill went up his spine and was filled with a nameless fear.

"Cap'n?"

"Vacate the ship, I need time."

## Captain's log, day 360

> I can be a dragon.

## Commodore's log, day 1

> I HAVE LEARNED MANY INTERESTING THINGS

Dewey glanced nervously at the data slate, sitting unused on his Commodore's desk, the latest entry was worrying, and he briefly wondered if Meetslab wrote all of his entries in all caps. Every wall was covered in notes and scribbles, the mattress had been flipped over to make more space and at the center of it all there was a diagram that looked an awful lot like a dragon.

"Dewey! To the bridge." Commanded his Commodore. 

*****

Meetslab had found spells that transformed his body, all of them had the limitation of his armor and equipment wouldn't be transformed with him. Dedication helped, by making your armor and equipment part of you, but there were limits.

***** 

Dewey stood at attention on the modified bridge. "Relax Dewey."

He did so and look around, the bridge had no windows, no way to see outside except for a screen that was only to be used when the other systems in the room were down.

"Dok?"

"Dewey," said Meetslab as he walked over, his heavy hand clasping the pauldron of his second in command's power armor. "Today we make history."

*****

Who are you anyway? What makes you, you? How does a transformation spell distinguish between your clothes and cells, stomach acid, gut bacteria, dead skin cells, hair... 

If Meetslab had asked anyone this question, it would turn into some sort of philosophical debate about the nature of self and all that nonsense. 

Meetslab wasn't asking anyone this question. Meetslab was asking Igneous, and either fortunately or unfortunately for the Wheel, the mutated goblin had an actual answer.

*****

"Dewey, I'm afraid I have no more use for you on my vessel."

Dewey's mind shut down, his hands fell limply to his sides.

Before he could recover: "Do you remember the BATNA?"

"Yes..."

"It's yours."

"What?"

Doktor Meetslab placed his hat on Dewey's head. "You are hereby promoted to Captain." He pulled up a hologram of the fleet, pointing out where the BATNA was. "The crew has already been informed, take  the shuttle, we're leaving soon."

"Aye Aye!"

Meetslab saluted his crew member, "Congratulations."

After Dewey left he faced the console once more, poked it a couple of times to activate the ansible, bringing up the faces of Nero, Sleepy Pete, Kork the Chief Ork from Acheron, Frank Earnest, and Felicity. Together ready to finally retake Cadia.

"My friends, it is time. Today we make history. Connect me to the rest of the fleet, I think it's time I made a speech."

Frank gave him the go ahead.

"The Wheel is unfair. It has always been unfair, it has treated its inhabitants like dirt, it has kicked us down, it has subjected us to unspeakable torment..."

*****

Tim stabbed a carved cube of dragon meat and roasted it over the tiny fire. He had been regaling the newbies with the tale of how he fought the ferocious dragon queen, but had stopped at the sound at the voice of his battle comrade Meetslab emanating from the comm-bead artifact that lay next to the bag

"...and yet, here we stand! Unbroken!"

The mice cheered.

*****

Michael walked at a sedate pace, accompanied by his battle brothers and sisters, wading through the mass of abominations with contemptuous ease. Each of the Paladins that flanked him swung their noisy chain weapons, carving through the horde and thinning it out without breaking a sweat. Their every blow was enhanced by the armor of power they had been gifted. The foul Undead were almost entirely unable to deal any kind of damage in response, clawing uselessly against the thick plate. When they felt overwhelmed, the back line archers retaliated with weapons that fired beams of light, easily carving even further through the horde. 

Michael shook his head, he didn't know why he was here, he clearly wasn't needed, he had insisted on carrying the bag of holding, and was carrying spare supplies and ammunition to feed the archers. He was shown bits and pieces of the epic war Meetslab was about to embark in, but it quickly became clear that he would be unable to meaningfully contribute. He apologized and returned home.

He hung back to escape the noisy chain weapons and the flashes of light so he could better hear the speech coming out of this... 'radio'."

"This world will not give us what we want, and if it won't? Then we will take it from it!"

Michael nodded approvingly.

*****

Two radical monks stared at each other in their hut, covered wall to wall in totes awesome champ pics. 

They were like, just chillin' when one was all like, "Dude."

And so the other was like "Dude?"

So the other was totally exasperated and was all "Duuuuuude..."

So he's all rolling his eyes and like: "Dude!"

But, like, the other doesn't get it right? And is so, like: "Dude, dude, dude."

Then the other does a Grave Nod. "Dude."

And then the radio next to the holdin' sack is all: "People will make the Wheel fair! We will piece through the darkness, we will burn through the hatred, we will make the world a better place!"

The two monks made finger guns at the radio. 

*****

Meetslab swept his gaze around to his fellow commodores. "Let us patch a hole in the darkness. Let us retake Cadia!"

"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!"

They shut off their connections, he tapped the console one last time before it retreated into a compartment in the floor, activating Igneous' final gift.

The semi-spherical room came to life, needles protruded out of the center of the circles on the surface of the spheres. The circles themselves followed suit, extending into long tendrils that whipped dangerously, each tipped with a needle. Meetslab opened ports all over his body, and in quick succession each of them shot unerringly into ports until he was covered head to toe in the wires. He looked up as the system initialized.

His old boss was still there, staring impassively. "Y'know, if it weren't for that bathroom, none of this would've happened. I think the Wheel owes that bathroom a debt of gratitude.

Meetslab hummed non-committally "Are you ready?"

Pete snorted. "Of course, are you?"

A robotic female voice chimed in: "Platonic Bridge initialized."

His consciousness expanded, he could feel the world around Whalord in that odd way that it perceives thing. He made his Ork body respond with a cheeky grin. "I didn't make twenty-one thousand and forty two castings of Dedication to not be ready, lets give them hell."

"Aye aye, commodore."

Pete disconnected and Doktor Meetslab cast his spell. 

*****

Those in the close vicinity of the S.S. Whalord witnessed an incredible transformation take place. They stared unbelievably as the whale shuddered and changed shape, its fins extending and growing claws, it's face shrinking and protruding outwards into a head perched on a long neck, giant leathery wings shot out of the back, the tail fin extending into a sharp tail. Just as it seemed to be done, that is when it doubled in size along every dimension.

The Destroyer sized dragon roared, and it's Waaaagh! cry was felt by every mind in a thousand Void Units. 

That is how the story of Commodore Doctor Doktor "Dragonjammer" Meetslab begun.

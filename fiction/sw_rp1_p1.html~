<h1>Star Wars: Episode IX, Act I</h1>

<i>
<p>I've been thinking about Star Wars lately. Specifically about what a mess they've got going in to Episode IX. No main villain, missing worldbuilding, philosophy that's gone back on itself, a hero who hasn't won over a large portion of the fanbase...</p>

<p>I'm pessimistic that the actual Episode IX will handle this, but I do think it's possible. I'm picturing something like this:</p>

<h3>Text Crawl:</h3>

<p>Six months have passed since the death of Supreme Leader Snoke. The First Order has fractured. The fragments war with each other, and have mostly forgotten the Resistance.</p>

<p>In the chaos, General Leia traveled to Coruscant to try to restart the New Republic. She has not been heard from since. Few hope she is still alive.</p>

<p>The Resistance, such as it is, has failed to rebuild

<p>We open on board the Millenium Falcon. Rey is studying the texts she stole from the Jedi Temple. A paper book is open on the center of her desk, with datapads around it showing dictionaries and commentaries. She's frustrated.</p>

<p>Anakin appears and introduces himself.</p>

<p>Rey: [backing away] Darth Vader!
Anakin: Yes and no.</p>

<p>She asks about his appearance, and he explains that force ghosts look like they did at time of death. From one point of view, he died as a young man at the hands of Darth Vader, while from another, equally valid point of view, he died as an old man, at the hands of Darth Sideous. When he first began manifesting, which people saw depended on their state of mind, but as he has worked to pull himself together, he's appearing as an average.</p>

<p>Rey: It sounds like points of view are very important to jedi.
Anakin: Very important, yes. And very tricky. Easy to get wrong.</p>

<p>He tells her that he has no answers, but he can offer her an important question: What is the dark side of the force?</p>

<p>Rey: It's anger, hatred, fear, and the need to control others.
Anakin: That's a common path to the dark side, but it's not the dark side itself. And it's not the only path. I fell through love.
Rey: So what is the dark side, then?
Anakin: I don't know. I spent half my life under its power, and I don't know what it is. But you need to.
Rey: Sounds like more of a question for Kylo Ren.
Anakin: Perhaps you should share it with him.
Rey: Why don't you?
Anakin: I can't talk to him. He's so obsessed with his concept of me that he can't hear anything I say.
Rey: Well I have no way of reaching him. It was Snoke who connected us. Unless you can teach me that power...
Anakin: Jedi are allowed to do things the easy way.</p>

<p>Rey calls Kylo on the ship's comm system, threatens her way past the receptionist (he'll kill you if you don't patch me through), and shares Anakin's question.</p>

<p>Kylo: It's passion and will. It's fixing the world. Not accepting its brokenness, but making it do what you want.
Rey: And what do you want?</p>

<p>Kylo pauses, but before he can answer, Poe, Finn and Rose burst into the room. Kylo recognizes that this is important, and cuts the connection so she can talk to them without him hearing. Rose explains that she's been monitoring certain markets, and she believes the miniaturization problem on Starkiller Base has been cracked. The First Orders will be blowing up each other's planets from office-building size superweapons from light years away. First Order strategic doctrine will demand that any planet that *might* host a rival planet-killer must be destroyed. There might not be many survivors.</p>

<p>Rey calls Kylo again and confronts him over this. He does see the long-term consequences, and is on his way to destroy Hux's planet-killer now. He's sent forces against Phasma-28's base, but is less confident because he has no one to lead them. Rey volunteers. She promises to use them only for this purpose, and return them when she's done. Kylo communes with the force, then accepts.</p>

<p>While on route to Phasma-28's base, Rey receives another visit from Anakin. He tells her about the prophecy</p>

<p>Anakin: A child of no parents, or possibly no father, proto-tirknas grammar is ambiguous on that point, who will bring balance to the force. Qui-quon thought it was me, and that I would destroy the Sith forever. Sideous thought it was me, and that I did it by reducing the Jedi to two. But I know it wasn't me. I think it might be you.
Rey: It can't be me. I had parents. They might not have been important on a galactic scale. They might not have been very good parents. Or good people. But they were themselves. They were somebody. Maybe that's what the Dark Side is. It's looking at people and calling them “nobody”.
Anakin: [slow and thoughtful] That's... closer. But it's not quite it.
Rey: Then there's something I need to do.
Anakin: Then do so [vanishes]</p>

<p>Rey calls the temple caretaker that she nearly dropped a giant rock on and apologizes. The worker forgives her, and seems a bit surprised to be called.</p>

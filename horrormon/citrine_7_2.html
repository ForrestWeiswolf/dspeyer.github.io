<h1 id="vidriot">Vidriot</h1>
<p>Vidriot is great!</p>
<p>We fought some wolves on the way there. They had media for some reason. It was weird. They shot the cozy cloud and tried to kill us but we killed them instead.</p>
<p>Oh also I don't remember whether this happened before or after Vidriot but at some point Sarah used a spell that we didn't know what it did and it transported us all into a weird empty future place where a giant faceless April was holding a bunch of Chaos Emeralds and a little dot called TIME, and I grabbed the little dot called TIME and then we were back in the regular universe and I put TIME in my pocket. Oh, wait, it must have been before Vidriot because I think I hadn't met April yet when that happened.</p>
<p>I think perhaps using spells that we don't know what they do is a bad idea and we should stop doing it.</p>
<p>Anyway the important thing about Vidriot is that they have FUNNEL CAKE.</p>
<p>Funnel cake is so good! It's squiggly and tasty and fun! (Is that why they call it funnel cake? No, I don't think it is.)</p>
<p>We met April while we were in Vidriot. She was eating funnel cake, which was very reasonable of her. She used to be friends with Sarah and Clarence and I think she still thinks they are friends but I think Sarah and Clarence do not think that. Sarah hugged her but it was a hug for spying and not a hug for friendship. She has a funny way of talking, she's very cheerful and always seems like she's having a lot of fun and when someone asks her to do something she likes to say &quot;I could do that, or, on the other hand, I could not.&quot; Otto said it back to her once and she giggled like it was the funniest thing in the world.</p>
<p>There was only one time when I saw her look like she wasn't having fun, and that was when she was talking about what makes a good murder spree (the good ones are the ones where she's doing the murdering, apparently) and Clarence said something like what about all the people who get murdered, and she looked confused and asked what about them, and he looked sad, and then she looked kind of sad too. I think maybe she would like to be our friend. I am not sure she would be very good at it, though. She talks like she is a nice person but I think she is not one really.</p>
<p>We also met the Champion! He was nice. I wandered off and got lost while everyone was in the library, and I met him and talked to him about history, and he told me lots of neat things, and then my friends showed up and he decided to fight us for some reason, and we beat him up and took away his Chaos Emerald and then he stopped being mind-controlled by it. Then we had two Chaos Emeralds, a red one and a yellow one. Clarence put them in metal balls with handles, full of stabilization oil, and we keep them very cold so bad things won't happen around them.</p>
<p>After we met the Champion, Hangmon attacked the city. Hangmon is a big horrible puppet thing hanging on cables and surrounded by a bunch of very large eyeballs. The flying eyeballs have fifty hit points each, and I noticed that this meant that if we could get together five Ooziels and blow them all up at the exact same time very close to the puppet, we could take away all of its eyeballs and that would probably be a big help to Vidriot's defense. So we decided to do that. We went to a store and took some things and left behind some money to pay for the things we took, and the puppet attacked us with big crystal beams and blew up the building, so I guess leaving behind the money didn't do anyone any good.</p>
<p>The fight against Hangmon was mostly pretty fun, but one time I was carrying Sarah and Jacqueline and one of the puppet cables caught my arm and made me drop them, and it was really upsetting. Sarah broke her legs. I don't want Sarah to break her legs and I don't like that I did that, even though it wasn't really me doing it.</p>
<p>Anyway eventually we killed the puppet, mostly by blowing up lots of Ooziels at it since that was what we had, and the Vidriot militia helped some, and then a big spike dropped out of the sky with a note attached to it that said &quot;watch your back&quot;, which I was confused about, but my friends said it was a threat, so I guess the puppeteer didn't like that we killed their puppet. Also the puppet dropped the biggest soulfruit, it was a cluster like Parasonico's but it was so much of a cluster that it was practically a tree. I put it in my medium because my capacity is small anyway so it's not that big a deal if I have an enormous mon in my soul and have to shuffle an extra thing around when I'm swapping out mons and spells.</p>
<p>After that, Vidriot didn't really want us around anymore, which seems very fair of them, so we left.</p>

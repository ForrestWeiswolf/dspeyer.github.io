tell why, nor whether these were her normal tentacles mysteriously
glowing or new tentacles of light grown for the purpose.  Perhaps
this was actually a dream too.<br/>

The mons in the towers had vanished, and the phylacteries had
reverted to corpses.  Rather than let the tenants of the building
drink corpse-water, I slashed open the remaining water towers.  I
left the corpses in place, though.  Once the plumbers realized they'd
had corpses in the water towers, they'd sterilize the entire system. 
Hopefully.</p>

In hindsight, something was up with that building.  Even if
Emerald-lady only arrived today, the apartment was too weird to just
be a random apartment she broke into, and the water tower
phylacteries probably took time to prepare.  Perhaps the local
authorities will investigate and we'll hear about it over the radio.</p>

We recovered bits and pieces.  Marianna had spent most of the time
under Saurin's control.  At one point, he seemed to have extracted
spells from her heart.  At another, they visited the heart of the
Tall Woods where the Emerald there had formed a pocket dimension and
left behind a ring gate.  And whenever it seemed like she might be
starting to think for herself again, he brought her to a (wild?) Tall
Man and asked it to perform Proxy.</p>

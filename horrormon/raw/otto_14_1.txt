# Nosgoth

Not recounting what we *did* in Nosgoth, because we didn't *do* very much.  But some things we *learned*...

...About vampires:

* While pre-cataclysm vampires drank blood straight from the artery, modern vampires must drink blud, which has a much more complex manufacturing process.  If they don't get regular blud, they start to open gates, which is bad.
* Blud contains all the aspects of a person.  Blood only contains memories.  Apparently, Jacqueline can extract someone's memories by drinking raw blood.  At least if they aren't under amnesia-based mind control.
* All vampires are welcome in Nasgoth.  They may bring guests.
* Other than vampires and their guests, Nasgoth contains nullified, who are used as a labor force and as sex toys.
* All vampires can fly.  They don't need to turn into bats or anything: they just float off the ground.
* Jacqueline had her inquisitive personality before her amnesia, though it was more toned down and mixed with useful skills then.
* Vampires *do* have working televisions.  They believe they are the only ones to do so.  They do not, however, have their own television stations.  Mons broadcast surreal tv shows for no apparent reason.

...About the world:

* Nasgoth has existed in some form since before the Cataclysm.  Early on, they made alliance with Lily in a way that did not involve completely surrendering their minds.
* It does require performing tasks for her.  Jacqueline was “checking on” some of Lily's dungeons when she got trapped and memory-wiped.
* Nasgoth had several Warp Emeralds *before* the Cataclysm.  Back then, they weren't very useful.  A dangerous boost to Warp Magic, which was already dangerous and powerful.
* Placing an Emerald in a medium (either directly or via a Box spell) empowers the medium while driving the user insane.  Placing an Emerald in *stabilization oil* in a medium (via a Box spell) does nothing).
* If you leave an Emerald unattended for long enough, it will create a demiplane and retreat into it, leaving a Ring Gate.  This is possibly the only bit of magic that *didn't* change in the Cataclysm.
* Ring Gates drip energy that can be easily distilled into Locator spells, or with more difficulty into useful spells.  (So why are there so few Locator spells in the world?  We didn't ask.)
* Nasgoth rented a single Emerald to Saurin shortly before the Cataclysm, which may have caused it.  If so, this was a terrible mistake.  This does not match with the vague histories of The Theft that we found in Vidriot.
* About 200 years ago, Saurin bought all the Emeralds Nasgoth had, along with all Locator and Locator-Locator spells, from a low-ranking vampire who had no right to sell them.  King Kaine blamed the sale on “stupidity”, but given his leadership style, I wonder if some underling simply wanted to ruin him.
* King Kaine would very much like to get the Emeralds back, but not enough to (for example) send agents to places that seemed to be going insane in an Emarldy way.  We did not suggest this (nor reveal what we had).

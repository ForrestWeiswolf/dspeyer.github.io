# The Escape

After the long gap, my first memories went something like this:

> I awake in darkness and confusion.
> 
> *Observe; orient; decide; act.*
> 
> I observe nothing whatsoever.
> 
> I have no idea where I am.  Or when I am.  Or who I am.  As the
> med-techs would say, I am oriented x0.
> 
> I still have no idea what to do.
> 
> This didn't work.
> 
> OK, again more slowly.
> 
> Observe.  I see nothing.  I hear my own breathing, echoing off
> something hard and close.  I reach out and feel cold walls around me.
> I smell and taste nothing. I propriocept that I am standing up.
> That's an odd way to awaken.
> 
> Orient.  I know which way is down.  My feet are pointed in that
> direction.  That is good.  I don't know who I am, but based on my
> sense of what med-techs say being different from what I say, I must
> not be a med-tech.  Is that good?  I don't know.  One of them might be
> useful right now.
> 
> Decide.  I decide to investigate the walls more thoroughly.
> 
> Act.  I push on them.  The ones to the sides and behind me don't
> budge, but the one it front of me seems to give just a little bit.
> 
> I push harder, bracing my back against the back wall.  Eventually,
> the front wall gives.  And then it falls to the ground with a terrible
> crash.
> 
> I emerge into a more reasonably sized room.  It has lights on the
> ceiling and an emblem on the floor.  The emblem of an army.  An evil
> army?  An army that committed some sort of atrocity... at some point?
> 
> An army whose organization placed aerial and ground based units under
> the same squadron commanders in order to maximize coordination of
> close air support.
> 
> I can't remember my *name* but I remember that useless bit of
> trivia.
> 
> Oh, wait.  My name is Otto.  That's better.

I found myself in a decent size room.  One wall had four ordinary size
doors, while the opposite wall had one giant door.  There were four
other sarcophagi, similar to the one I had just exited.

I seemed to be a prisoner.

So I knew some enemy had overcome me, but had chosen not to finish me
off.

*That which does not kill me has made a tactical error.*

Sure it has.

Did the other sarcophagi contain people?  Friends?

"Is anybody else in here?" I asked in a loud voice.

Answering voices came from two of the sarcophagi.  Saying variants of "I'm
here; where is here?"

The other prisoners had a hard time budging their doors, even
with instructions.  I spotted a crowbar lying on the floor and used it to
help pry the doors off.  Then I caught them as they toppled over and
gently set them on the ground.

The other people emerged.  Both were wearing masks,
with the same symbol from the floor.

I checked my face.  I was also wearing a mask.  I peeled it off.  They did
the same.

I still didn't recognize them.  They gave their names as Mark and
Edmund, which I also didn't recognize.  They didn't know where we are
either.

I saw they had weird metal spirals on their arms.  On closer
examination, so did I.  It was attached somehow.  And felt vaguely
ominous.

*****************************************************

We decide to try opening one of the remaining sarcophagi, in case it
contains someone in need of help, or simply too shy to call for help.

Instead, it contained a horrible undead monstrosity.

There were three of us.  I had a crowbar and Mark has a giant can
opener (why? how?),   But it was strong and tough enough to put up a
hard fight, and its claws were decent weapons in their own right.
Eventually, we put it down.  Then I stuck the sharp
end of the crowbar below its C7 vertebra and popped its head off.  I
didn't know (still don't) if this thing could come back from a
beat-down, but that should make it harder.

*When in doubt, go for the head.*

The noises from the final sarcophagus suggested a similar monster was
trying to get out.  So we leaned all the other doors against that
one.  Each door was a heavy slab of stone, so five of them together
was enough to hold even these things.

****************************************************

We took a closer look around the room.

The big door had a keyhole.  None of us had a key.

There were some lines on the floor, each leading from a glowing thing
to one of the ordinary-size
doors.  Each had a gap missing.  Lying in a corner was a tile with a
straight line across it, exactly the width of the gap.

This had to be how they *intended* for us to open the doors.

But we didn't have a better option.

Hoping to be slightly unpredictable, we opened the second door from the
left first.  The room was long and narrow, with a big metal ball and a
small glowing ball at the end.  Mark advanced carefully, and stopped
when he felt his hair standing on end.

A powerful electrical charge?  Those can be addressed by grounding via a sharp
metal point of contact.  I stuck the blunt end of the crowbar down the
neck of the undead thingy, then shoved it toward the metal ball.  I
made sure it's dripping fluid (blood?) for a good electrical contact
to the floor.  As expected, lightning started arcing from the metal
ball to the sharp end of the crowbar.  The body twitched.  *Lightning
doesn't revive undead, right?  It's just a seizure thing?*  (The
undead did not revive.)

By shoving the body very close to the metal ball and drawing all the
current, I was able to creep up to the glowing ball and seize it.  Then
I pulled the body back into the central room.

*Apparently I was someone who had dealt with electricity traps before.
Or zapped people for fun.  Maybe I had gotten an electrical burn as body art?
I checked my biceps.  Nothing*

Anyway, I now had a glowing ball.  I passed it from hand to hand
examining it and it slides into the metal spiral on my arm.  That was
kind of disturbing.

But I could control it in the spiral.  I moved it back and forth, and
back out again.  I put it in and willed it to *do something*.  Suddenly,
I was holding a sword.  Single-edged, mildly curved, short hilt-guard,
weight a bit forward.  Very choppy, but still a decent point.  I kept
it and pass the crowbar to Edmund.

*Apparently I was someone who knew how to evaluate swords.*

*********************************************

We tried door number one next.  The room was the same shape.  At the far
end, there was another glowing ball and a giant eye.

If we got more than halfway into the room, the eye would see us and a grate
would slam down in front of the ball.

We tried gauging out the eye by throwing the crowbar and can opener, but
this didn't help.

After a bit of poking around, we went back and got one of the
sarcophagus doors.  This meant there are only four holding in the
undead monster, but that was enough.  We set the door on its
side against one wall and slid it forward.  The eye wasn't set up to
see things like this, so we get it under the grate before the eye
triggered.  The grate slammed down onto the door, but couldn't slam any
further.  Edmund crawled under and claims the ball.

It didn't summon a sword.  It summoned a monster.  An especially
hideous monster the size of a horse that could climb walls like an
insect.  And it breathed fire.

(Looking back, I think it was a Red Shadow, but it's hard to be sure.)

The monster was really quite ominous, but it obeyed its summoner, so
we kept it.  We weren't really in a position to be picky.

There was also a glowing line on the wall with a rearrangeable tile.
We broke the line and the zappy-ball in the second room turned off.
Maybe we should have done these in the other order.

******************************************************

Third room.  Yikes.

There were giant spiky crushers emerging from the walls and slamming
against each other in the middle.  Anything in the room when they
closed would be squashed flat *and* thoroughly perforated.

They stretched from floor to ceiling and were maybe a foot wide.
There were several, and they had a pattern.

I didn't bother learning it.

I just got the door again, set it horizontally on the floor this time,
and slid it into the room.

The crushers were strong, but they weren't strong enough to crush two
feet of solid stone.

And they were rigid enough that when the bottom was stopped, the whole
thing stopped.  That had been my biggest worry.

Once this had worked, I calmly walked down the safe middle of the
room.  My comrades followed, less calmly.

There was a hole in the floor.  I grabbed the edge, shifted to
dangling by my fingers, and dropped onto the floor below.  There was a
chair here, so I positioned it under the hole to let the others get down
more easily.

This room was the same size as the one above it, and had one doorway.

Through the door we found the room underneath room 4 (assuming
sensible geometry, which was in fact the case).  There was a hole in
the ceiling and a trampoline to help you get up through it.

Half the room was inaccessible, thanks to floor-to-ceiling bars.
Bouncing up to room 4, we found the same inaccessibility there.  In
fact, we found the same bars, which were two stories long.

There was a box here covered in razorvine.  It attacked me when I got
close, and regrew when I slashed at it.  So Edmund summoned his
fire-breathing monster and that took it right off.

When in doubt, set something on fire.

Inside the box we found two spells.  One to turn the caster into a
bear (regardless of medium type) and one which cloned the caster.

*****************************************************

My companions freaked out over the clone spell.

We did all the obvious tests.

Mundane objects can be duplicated by cloning yourself while holding
them.  Spells cannot.  One cannot cast ongoing spells while cloned.
This includes additional castings of clone.

The original and clone both feel normal
and have access to pre-fork memories.  They do not have telepathic
contact.  If the clone is merely unsummoned, the memory-streams do not
merge.  If he is dismissed, or the caster loses the spell, then the
original gets all the clone's memories.

Telling whether you are the clone or the original takes some effort.
The clone perceives the act of summoning as teleportation which the
original does not.  And, with practice, the original can feel the
ability to dismiss the clone spell.

Clone!Mark complained that if the spell was ever dismissed, he would
die.

Which was absurd.  Mark would *still be alive*.  The clone's memories
wouldn't even be lost!

Mark was unimpressed.

I tried to comfort him with the litany of general J' Mahdder:

> I am now dead.  I go into battle to recover my life.  Victory is
> life.  All else is death.

He was still unimpressed.

Ultimately it was decided that I should carry the clone spell.  Fine
with me.

*****************************************************

There were some more "puzzles" to solve to clear the bars out of the
way and obtain the final key.  I don't remember the details.
Something about connecting points with those tiles.

When we got the key, I cloned it on general principles.  We took it to
the big door and unlocked it.  The door ate the cloned key.

There's nothing like paranoia for coping with a world that really is
out to get you.

Beyond the door was a large chamber with a giant monster chained in
the center of it.  On the monster's collar was another key.  It was
hard to tell from a distance, but it looked identical to the key we
already had.

We crept around the side of the chamber, staying out of the monster's
reach.  When we made it to the door, we cloned again and turned the
key.  The door opened, and we had escaped.  Key still in hand; monster
still unfought.

The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting

*****************************************************

We emerged onto a steep hillside.  Rather than climb, we resummoned
the hideous wall-clinging beast and rode it down into the valley.  It
was not a comfortable ride, but we made it intact.

There were people in the valley below.  Just a small group, like
ourselves, settled around a campfire.  Friends?  Enemies?  Undecided?

We approached as unthreateningly as possible.  We got close while
being noisy so they could hear us.  Then Clone!I approached alone.
This simultaneously meant that with just one of us, we were no threat,
but with a disposable one of us, we were not threatened either.

They said this did not come across as unthreatening.  But they also
did not treat us as a threat.  So I call it a win.

They told us that the spirals we were wearing would inevitably drive
us insane, and that they could remove them and give us media that
wouldn't do that.  I didn't know what to think of this, but my
instincts said to trust them, so I did.

*****************************************************

It turns out there are lots of dungeons in the area like the one we'd
escaped from.  They also have keyholes on the outside, and I am an
unlimited source of keys.

Creating a fresh clone (and key) costs an energy.  And, no, I can't do
the exponential growth thing where Clone!I hand the clone!key to
orig!me and then reclone: cloned objects vanish when the spell is
dismissed.

But energy is easy to come by.  Our new friend Aaron just turns into a
dragon, flies down to the lizard-infested-ruins and roasts a bunch.
Each dead lizard leave a soulfruit, which can be eaten for energy.
Turning into a dragon costs a lot of energy, but that comes from
soulfruit too.

Most of the dungeon-rescuees just want to get back to normal life.
Aaron is thinking along similar lines, which means this new settlement
will have a dragon to protect it.  Probably a good thing.

One of the rescuees is interested in going adventuring, though.  Her
name is Jacqueline.  She's less looking for justice than answers, but
I bet once she has answers she'll want justice.

So it's just Sarah and Clarence from the spiral-removers, myself, and
Jacqueline heading out to save the world.  Not sure this is going to
be enough.

There's rumors about some broken power armor in a town north of here
that Clarence might be able to repair.  That sounds like exactly the
sort of force-multiplier we're going to need.

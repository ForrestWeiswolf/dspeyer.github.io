<h1 class="western">Vidriot</h1>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Our
objective in Vidriot was to gain information.  We went in without a
list of questions, so I can't really say if the answers we got were
the ones we wanted.  But we did learn some things.  And had a few
other noteworthy achievements as well.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
Vidriot town guard spotted us well before we reached the town.  They
seemed very aware and capable, and we were rather nervous.  My armor,
Jacqueline's sun-blocking outfit and Citrine's entire body were
glamoured, but we were far from ready for any serious deception.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
customs agents interviewed us one at a time.  We were able to conceal
little.  We didn't explain what our kettle-bell contained, and I kept
Anathema in marble form among my mundane gear, but they learned the
rest.  We did use the glamours to apply some judicious spin to the
truth.  I explained my Penetencian armor before they saw it, and I
described Citrine as “experimented on by mons” before they saw
her.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">They
took it in stride.  Citrine got a special ID card.  They managed to
fit safety chips into our literal first-generation transformation
breastplates.  They acknowledged “We're confused and looking for
answers” as a good reason to visit Vidriot.  The announcement that
we (well, Clarence) could repair Penetencian armor resulted in a job
offer.  I think I heard one of them mutter about needing a drink as
we left, but they didn't freak out even once with us there.  Very
professional.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">They
warned us that some sort of madness seemed to be taking root in the
vicinity of the ziggurat.  An understatement, we (and they) would
learn.</p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Wandering
through town we encountered April.  She was accompanied by a Tall
Man, glamoured as an excessively tall human, and eating a funnel
cake.  How?  We never figured that out.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">April
was superficially friendly, but refused to divulge anything about her
goals or her doings in the past centuries.  We suspected she was
there to steal the Emerald.  After an ominous discussion, we parted
amiably.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
warned the authorities.  They felt confident they could handle her. 
We emphasized that she'd been wearing a Steve-spiral for <i>250
years</i><span style="font-style: normal">.  They felt less
confident, but still determined to try.  I salute their courage.</span></p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
visited the library.  The librarian was … disconcerting ... but
ultimately helpful.  He even set us up with library cards and allowed
us to borrow books.  Their history collection filled in a few gaps,
though their texts on magical gems were quite limited.  As for
Suppression Fluid, he suggested contacting a practicing chemist.</p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
found such a chemist.  He tasted (!) the sample we brought him,
separated it into components, tasted them, and proclaimed it a
mixture of graphite, canola oil and antifreeze.  The first two would
be easy to find, and the latter he would be happy to manufacture for
us for a reasonable fee.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
also showed him the batteries.  He declined to taste the fluids
within, but determined how to use them to reset a medium.  Each
battery had the power to perform three resets.  We'd been carrying
some valuable loot!</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
commissioned the antifreeze, selling some spare Ooziels to cover the
cost.</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">*

<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Our
conversation with the Chemist suggested it is simply in the nature of
the Emeralds to generate heat, and we needed a way to get rid of it
or the oil would fail.  Actual refrigeration technology has withered
without the need for food sustaining it (though the mons had an
electric freezer, so apparently it's not forgotten altogether).</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Keeping
it simple, we collected a bunch of sand and hit it with cold
(“crystal”) attacks until it was frigid, then packed it around
the Kettlebell.  When it warms to room temperature, we'll repeat the
procedure.</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">*

<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">After
some reading, we concluded the real lore of interest must be inside
the ziggurat.  So we went in.  (Except Citrine, who wandered off in
search of more funnel cake.)</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
received a pamphlet, containing the rules of proper fighting.  Chief
among them: don't attack your opponent directly.  We weren't there to
fight (hah!), but it was good to know.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
doorwardens challenged us to a fight.  We explained that we weren't
there to fight, but to learn.  We were journalists, Jacqueline
explained, perhaps thinking this would get a better reception
(Really?  Does anyone not hate journalists?).  They interpreted this
as “inspectors”, and took us to their manager.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Said
manager turned out to have an extremely large head, laced with
glowing yellow bits.  In hindsight, this was a warning sign.  He
directed the doorwardens to their instructional pamphlets: “We do
not have inspections.  Ever.  They're intruders!  Get them!”  But
the wardens still seemed confused.  He ruled that our trickery had
defeated the first challenge, and that we might advance.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
hate to win a battle by trickery, but I'm not sure outsmarting these
people could have been avoided.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">I
was encouraged that we seemed to have now met someone sane.  My hopes
were soon dashed as he introduced his rroboduelists.  Flesh, he
explained, was weak.  He had achieved dueling perfection by creating
machines that could use media.  It would have been an extraordinary
accomplishment had he actually done it.  But the rroboduelists were
<i>obviously</i><span style="font-style: normal"> humans in cardboard
costumes.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-style: normal">(As
an aside, he pronounced rroboduelists with the rolled r that was used
</span><span style="font-style: normal">as a shibboleth </span><span style="font-style: normal">in
the old Militant Church of Vectron back in the Age of Colonialism. 
No one else we've met has used this phoneme.  A sign of his true
allegiance?  Probably not.  Inconvenient because none of us could
actually pronounce our adversaries?  Definitely.)</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-style: normal">The
rroboduelists were committed to their characters.  The</span><span style="font-style: normal">y</span><span style="font-style: normal">
boldly ignored “this statement is false”, but </span><span style="font-style: normal">accepted
our challenge to compute square roots, which knocked one of them out
of the fight before it began.  The other two drew decks and fought.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-style: normal">We
fought according to the rules.  A slow back-and-forth of mon against
mon.  </span><span style="font-style: normal">Exactly how this
interacts with transformative media was somewhat unclear, and at one
point I turned to the manager for a ruling.  He declared there were
no rules.  So I yanked both adversaries</span><span style="font-style: normal">'</span><span style="font-style: normal">
decks out of their hands, disabling them.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
The enemy's gate is down.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-style: normal">The
defeated rroboduelists still did not break character.  Not even when
we declared an intent to disassemble and reverse-engineer them.  We
got as far as learning that the cardboard was held on with duct tape
and that they wore excessive body paint before their master begged us
to stop, offering us anything we wanted in exchange.  We asked him
some questions, but he didn't know very much.  </span><span style="font-style: normal">We
also removed the masks and saw that the rroboduelists' eyes were
glazed over as with severe compulsion magic, but we had no idea what
to do for them.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-style: normal">(</span><span style="font-style: normal">Later,
frustrated with the phonemics, I recounted this as “We fought the
oboeduellists and knocked them flute.  They turned out to be total
bassoons.”  No one made a clarinet pun.)</span></p>

</span><span style="font-style: normal">C</span><span style="font-style: normal">hampion.
 </span><span style="font-style: normal">I took the opportunity to
charge a hyperbreaker to full.  I also raised the question of whether
we should regard The Champion as an enemy or an opponent.  After all,
if we were determined to steal the Emerald which probably powered the
Heart of Cards, we'd likely find ourselves as enemies soon enough. 
My assumptions here were quite mistaken – a warning that we still
don't know enough about this world – so I am glad my comrades
insisted on the “opponent” approach.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
We entered The Champion's arena and found Citrine already there,
chatting casually with him.  How had she gotten here?  Well, she got
lost, and wandered a bit.  Makes as much sense as anything.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
The Champion declared that if we defeated him we would be blessed
with cards straight from the Heart.  Considering how many decks we'd
seen on the way in, I asked if he lost often.  He said yes.  His job
was to test us, not to keep all out, and a good test was one people
often passed.  This was not the philosophy embraced by my teachers
back in officer training...</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
In any case, we fought.  It wasn't much of a fight.  He opened with a
hat trick, concealing his actual location, and sent a Leviazizmuth
out to face us.  The Leviazizmuth didn't last long against Citrine's
beam and my fully-charged Hyperbreaker.  Perhaps their reputation is
inflated.  He had a variety of defensive options, but not enough for
our sheer attacks-per-second.  He surrendered.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
As we discussed the fight afterwards, he reflected that taking on as
large a team as us was a mistake.  He should have insisted we face
him in smaller groups.  While I have little fondness for excuses, I
can't actually call him wrong.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-style: normal">But
just as we thought the challenges had resolved to a quiet anticlimax,
we found ourselves </span><i>somewhere else</i><span style="font-style: normal">.</span></p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
The room no longer had doors.  I'm not sure if it had walls, or just
eternal darkness.  It definitely didn't have a ceiling, and the Heart
of Cards hung above us.  It was the shape of a human heart, and the
size of a small house.  There was a small hole punched deep into the
left atrium, from which shone an ominous yellow light.  Meanwhile,
the floor was absolutely covered in cards.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
I was reminded of the effect when one looks at the sun, or that
alterverse castle from the mons' recordings.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-style: normal">The
Champion transformed as well, albeit more slowly </span><span style="font-style: normal">and
apparently painfully</span><span style="font-style: normal">.  His
body grew, and glowed, as if it was being inflated by glowing
yellow... stuff.  We all piled on, in some mixture of comforting hugs
and judo pins.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
When the Champion completed his transformation, he released some sort
of shock wave that knocked us all away, except for one of me that
held on.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-style: normal">On
the logic that our enemy was now mind controlled and I had the only
nonlethal option, one of me focussed on blood-choking him.  Air
chokes probably don't work anymore, since breathing has become
aesthetic, but blood seems to still be the body's energy currency. 
This became difficult as </span><span style="font-style: normal">in
his new form, he was stronger than me.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
He used no deck, but cards would sometimes pick themselves up from
the floor and cast themselves.  Was he doing it?  Was the Heart?  We
were never sure.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
We tried to get at the Heart, but had limited vertical options. 
Sarah got some use of a giant floating vat, and one of me tried to
dangle from the heart by a sword.  Neither was very successful.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
Meanwhile, the Champion now had a way of stabbing us directly in the
mind – bypassing pinned arms, active mons, or even being
transformed into a mon.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
As the fight started to turn against us, I decided to deny our enemy
resources by setting fire to the cards on the floor.  They say only a
fool fights in a burning house, but they also say if you're not
willing to incinerate your own position, you're not willing to win. 
So I'm not sure if this was a good idea, really.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
In any case it proved unnecessary.  My blood choke finally succeeded.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-style: normal">But
</span><span style="font-style: normal">that wasn't the end.  The
Heart might or might not have been actively fighting us, but we were
still stuck in this strange space (which was now on fire).  The
answer had to be in The Heart.  Perhaps removing the Emerald? 
Citrine's tentacles might be long and thin enough.  I urged her to
stand on my shoulders to get high enough.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
She reminded me that she could fly.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
In my defense, the glamour hid her wings.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-style: normal">As
it has been said: List </span><i>all</i><span style="font-style: normal">
your assets when planning an engagement.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
This worked.  A moment later, we were back in the Champion's Arena in
the real world.  The Champion was human again.  There was no Heart,
no cards, no fire.  Citrine held the Chaos Emerald in her bare
tentacle.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
I was left wondering just how early we could have done that.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><i>The
enemy's gate is down.</i></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
Soon The Champion woke up.  He vomited glowing yellow stuff and a
spell (the mind-stabby one).  He looked around in confusion, and
asked us what had happened, and what day it was.  His memories of the
past six months were fuzzy.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
We were worried about leaving two Chaos Emeralds in one Kettlebell of
Stabilization Oil, and proposed going out to collect the antifreeze
which should be ready by now.  The Champion objected to our leaving,
saying that the police would want to interview all of us.  As a
compromise, one of me went and one of me stayed.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-style: normal">As
I ran to the Chemist's Shop and back, </span><span style="font-style: normal">I
noticed that roughly one fifth of the citizens were either vomiting
yellow goo or rubbing their heads and asking what had happened.  On
the one hand, so much for low profiles.  On the other, did we just
save this city?</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-style: normal">T</span><span style="font-style: normal">he
Champion showed us a bunch of Emerald-related carvings in the lower
levels of the Ziggurat.  Apparently the Emeralds had been
instrumental in separating the Materium from the Warp in the first
place, and here were instructions on </span><i>creating</i><span style="font-style: normal">
them, along with an ominous image of a human with spirals on both
arms casting some sort of double-helix into the sky, reaching Steve
and Lily.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
There were also instructions on using them.  Just hold one in your
hand and cast old, warp-style magic.  ::grumble::  Doing so is bad
for your sanity, but once every few days is probably safe.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-style: normal">He
also revealed that t</span><span style="font-style: normal">his
Emerald had been brought to the Ziggurat about 6 months ago by a
kobold named Saurian.  This is also the name of the kobold who
</span><span style="font-style: normal">brought an Emerald to Sarah

Popular kobold pseudonym?</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
(And why is there a kobold still around and koboldy, when all the
humans and elves and squats merged into modern “humans”?)</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
In any case, the city officials were very grateful that we had freed
their home, and were very pleased that we could keep the Emerald
harmless for now, and planned to take it far away soon.</p>

week that followed was surprisingly quiet.  Clarence repaired the
armor and got paid.  (Turns out jump-rockets are an armor expansion,
but they weren't for sale.  Perhaps a small raid on Penetencia is in
order?)  I read a lot of books.  Sometimes two at once, with both
sets of memories combining when I merged.  We built a bunch of
Kettlebells (decoys for now, but with real stabilization oil </span><span style="font-style: normal">for

a week, one of the decoy Kettlebells disappeared from our hotel room.
 Neither we nor hotel management saw anything.  Naturally, we
suspected April and her teleporting Tall Man.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
But before we could investigate this, an air raid siren went off. 
The town was under attack.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
The hotel staff urged us to head for the shelters.  Instead we went
to the militia to offer our services.  They told us the attacker was
Hangmon – a puppet reaper grown to colossal size.  The puppet was a
dragon corpse surrounded by eight eyes.  The puppeteer was too high
to see.  And the cables that connected them could connect to our mons
and media as well.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
Given the types and the presence of multiple targets, Citrine
proposed that an Ooziel barrage might be effective.  The militia
weren't interested, and told us to do our own thing while they did
there's.  They were probably on to something.  Glomming armies
together with no shared traditions or command structure is not a
strategy with a good record.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
As the monster approached, I swapped in Anathema.  Desperate times;
desperate measures.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-style: normal">We
needed more Ooziels, so we broke into the mon shop.  They had three

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
The plan was to send five Ooziels in unison, to fly up and detonate. 
Six base damage times five Ooziels times two for the types meant
sixty damage to each of the eyes and the puppet-dragon.  Enough to
drop the eyes altogether.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
As it has been said: Always blind the bastards.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%">
There was an ominous frost on the ground, so we climbed to the roof
of the shop.  This also allowed us to clearly see the enemy.  From
there, we put our plan into action.</p>

It has been said: No battle plan survives contact with the enemy.</p>

But this one did.</p>

Not all good news is enemy action.</p>

I slung Clarence onto my back and lept for the next house, while
Citrine grabbed Sarah and Jacqueline (Can Jacqueline turn into a
flock of bats?  She should try that.  But not in the middle of
battle.)</p>

Once we got into range, I tried Anathema on the creature.  For a
moment, something seemed to happen, complete with ominous visuals. 
But then nothing did.</p>

it's attacks were also of limited effectiveness.  Blind, it groped

a cable could cause it to detach.  At first I used this </span><span style="font-style: normal">to
free any mons or media it grabbed, but then I discovered this applied
to the cables holding the giant dragon as well.  At the beginning,
twelve cables supported the thing, and it turned out seven was the
minimum to keep it in the air.  The mon could reattach cables, as
fast as two a second, but at an opportunity cost of doing other
things.  I could snip 1.2 per second with both of me using rapid-fire
mode on the hyperbreaker.  It didn't quite realize the danger in
time, or take it quite seriously enough.  So after a few rounds of
exchanging blows, we had it on the ground and mostly combat
ineffective.</span></p>

Anyway, eventually we defeated the puppet.  It dropped an enormous
cluster of soulfruit, which we shlurped, though none of our media are
anywhere near the capacity needed to summon it.  I wonder how one
increases the capacity of a medium...</p>

The puppeteer wandered off.  We'll probably face it again some day. 
Hopefully from dragonback.</p>

It left a note.  Scrawled on a piece of cloth, tied to a ten foot
spear it cast into the ground near us.  It said: “Watch your back.”</p>

<h2>Research Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Rapid re-identification of human samples using portable DNA sequencing</b> -- <a href=https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/27798/elife-27798-v1.pdf>Using Nanopore Sequencers to identify individuals from whom DNA was taken</a>.  With Sophie Zaaijer, Assaf Gordon, Robert Piccone, Simon Cornelis Groen, and Yaniv Erlich.  I devised the core algorithm and did the first test; the coauthors took it from there.  Published in eLife.  Previously prepublished as <a href=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/06/30/061556.full.pdf>Democratizing dna fingerprinting</a>
<li><b>DNA.Land</b> -- <a href=https://www.nygenome.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/DNA.Land-is-a-framework-to-collect-genomes-and-phenomes-in-the-era-of-abundant-genetic-information.pdf>A framework to collect genomes and phenomes in the era of abundant genetic information</a>.  With Jie Yuan, Assaf Gordon, Richard Aufrichtig, Dina Zielinski, Joseph Pickrell and Yaniv Erlich.  I contributed various features to the DNA.Land project.  Published in Nature Genetics.
<li><b>Using mobile sequencers in an academic classroom</b> -- <a href=https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/14258/elife-14258-v1.pdf>A case study of using nanopore sequencers in class.</a>  I was a student in the class, so this is more research <i>on</i> me than <i>by</i> me, but I'm technically on the coauthor list, and my code is offered as an example of student work in such a class.  Since I was the only one to solve the second "hackathon", my code probably qualifies as a <i>cherry-picked</i> example, but what can you do?  Published in eLife.
<li><b>Is there a Firefox Gene?</b> Short answer: no.  Long answer: <a href=https://medium.com/@dl1dl1/is-there-a-firefox-gene-1ed804a215f6>searching for one reveals a lot about what genetic research is like</a>
<li><b>CNN Trojan Defense</b> -- <a href=trojan-defender.pdf>Inserting Trojan Horses into Convolutional Neural Nets, and then detecting them</a>.
<li><b>Causal Inference</b> -- <a href=causality.pdf>Inferring Causality from Finite Data using Conditional Independence</a>, with special interest in microbiome disruption and Ileal Crohn's Disease.
<li><b>Recursive Systemic Profiler</b> -- <a href=profiling.pdf>Profiling systems which spread across many processes</a>
<li><b>SpatialTable</b> -- <a href=spatialtable.pdf>A Bigtable-style distributed database for spatial information and rectangle queries.</a>  Faster than geohashing at the 99th percentile.
<li><b>Alignments</b> -- <a href=alignments.pdf>A way of computing [DNA] sequence alignments</a> more efficiently than the normal dynamic programming approach, for sequences that are pretty similar to begin with.  The <a href=alignments.cc>raw source code</a> is also available.
<li><b>ForNet</b> -- This is a distributed logging system for large IP
networks.  I worked on it along with <a
href=http://isis.poly.edu/memon/>Professor Nasir Memon</a>, <a href=http://isis.poly.edu/kulesh>Kulesh
Shanmugasundaram</a>, Amos Wetherbee and Radion Khait.  Others have
worked on the project at other times as well.  The project has its own
<a href=http://isis.poly.edu/projects/fornet>webpage</a> and we wrote
a <a href=ForNet2004.pdf>report</a> about it.
<li><b>Semi-Automated Refactoring</b> -- This was a project I did as 
part of a class, and as such is not entirely complete.  The idea was
to detect sections of code that can and should be combined into single
functions to decrease bloat.  The software succeeded in finding some
such code, but it is not really ready for practical use.  You can read
<a href=autorefactor.pdf>my report</a> or you can
download <a href=autoref.tgz>the software</a>.

<h2>D&D Stuff</h2>
<ul>
<li><b><a href=dnd35/search.html>Monster Search</a></b> -- For when you need the right monster. [D&D 3.5]
<li><b><a href=dnd35/monster_builder.html>Monster Builder</a></b> -- For when no published monster will do. [D&D 3.5]
<li><b><a href=http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showsinglepost.php?p=13407222&postcount=168>Homebrew</a>
<li><b><a href=dtd_dice_sa.html>Dungeons the Dragonning Dice Roller</a> -- Probability Density Functions considering explosions.
<li><b><a href=http://age-of-warriors.appspot.com/>Age of Warriors</a></b> -- A fan sequal to Tome of Battle.  Mostly abandoned.
</ul>
<h2>Rationality</h2>
<ul>
<li><b><a href=http://lesswrong.com/lw/e24/the_fallacy_of_large_numbers/>The Fallacy of Large Numbers</a></b> -- When handwaving about large numbers just won't do.
<li><b><a href=stats.html>Statistics Calculator</a></b> -- Doesn't think for you, but does crunch the numbers (and gives you a few reminders of what you should be thinking about).
<li><b><a href=http://miscreeds.livejournal.com/7594.html>Exploring Moralspace</a></b> -- A first crack at metaethics.
</ul>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li><b><a href=rr>Rodent's Revenge</a></b> -- I was challenged to do something interesting in under 50 lines of readable javascript.  Success!
<li><b><a href=pipedream>Pipedream</a></b> -- The old gameboy game.  I really just wanted to see if I could do it in javascript without any serious graphics tools.  And who knew?  I could.
<li><b><a href=apums.py>Antepenultimate Minesweeper</a></b> -- Minesweeper has been around for a long time, and nobody actually added features to it.  Now I have.  A silly little game.  Not as silly as all the "ultimate" games out there which are really the same old games with eye candy, though.
